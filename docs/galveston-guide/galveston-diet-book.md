INTRODUCTION
From our first day of life until the last, our bodies are always changing.
This is a part of aging—a natural process no one can escape. But the
changes that happen to women in midlife are unique and are often
unsettling. Suddenly we’re having odd symptoms like hot flashes and an
accumulation of strange, new weight gain around our midsections. Our skin
can be very dry or wrinkling more. We may have joint pain, hair loss,
headaches, bloating, and worsening anxiety or depression. Sleep becomes
elusive. Sexual intercourse can hurt. Little things set us off.
A lot of this may be happening to you right now. Trust me, you are not
alone. Let me introduce you to someone who knows exactly what you’re
going through: me.
I was a busy physician, a mom, and a wife in my late forties. My main
health challenge at the time was polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a
condition caused by insulin resistance, in which insulin can’t do its job of
ushering glucose into cells for energy. PCOS leads to erratic periods, acne,
infertility, ovarian cysts, and unwanted hair growth.
About 1 in 10 women of childbearing age has PCOS. The majority (about
70 percent) are overweight or even obese, but I was among the 30 percent
of normal weight. Fortunately, PCOS is treatable, and in my case, taking
hormones greatly helped.
Then came a death in my family; I lost my brother, Bob, to liver failure. I
was despondent. He was my daughters’ favorite uncle, a creative fun spirit
with whom I had a special bond. We were dance partners when I was

younger, winning dance competitions all over Louisiana. When he died, I
was heartbroken, and losing him brought crushing pain.
Grief does strange things to each of us. For me, I coped by bingeing.
Night after night after long clinic shifts, I stood in front of my pantry,
gobbling handfuls of Goldfish crackers. I’d wash them down with glasses
of wine. Pretty quickly I gained nearly 20 pounds. I looked like a different
person, and I felt miserable.
With my medical background, I knew that at my age it might be time to
come off the hormones for a while. So, I talked to my own doctor, and we
agreed that I should.
But taking the hormones had masked the perimenopausal symptoms that
occur during midlife, so within two weeks of being off them, everything
abruptly changed—and not for the better. I had hot flashes and I felt like I
was burning from the inside out. Along came sleepless nights and, most
troubling of all, the fuzzy and forgetful feeling called brain fog. My long,
thick hair started falling out by the brushful. My skin felt parched from
head to toe, and I had to completely change my skincare routine to keep my
skin moisturized. My body ached so much that I kidded with a friend that
I’d give up my firstborn to get relief. My sleep became a recurring
nightmare of multiple awakenings through the night—at first drenched in
sweat, and then freezing once the hot flash passed.
I knew I was going through a period of hormonal change—
perimenopause—but the symptoms it produced were so profoundly intense
that I was really alarmed. All this on top of the weight gain? I was a mess.
Then I heard my brother Bob’s voice in my head. “Girl, you don’t have to
wallow in this anymore. You got yourself into this; you can get yourself
out.”
I went to work on my weight first. I did exactly what I and other doctors
had always counseled patients to do: eat less, exercise more.
My efforts paid off, sort of. I’d lose a pound or two, but that was it. Then
the weight would come right back on. I was starving myself and working
out obsessively, but hardly dropping any weight. It was very frustrating. I
just wanted to fix me, but nothing I did or tried was sticking.
I realized that I was struggling with the same weight issues many of my
patients had told me about. They would sit in the examining room, often
clutching paper gowns, and ask for advice about losing weight, frustrated
with the fact that they had changed their diet and exercise habits and yet the

scale kept moving in the wrong direction. I’d spend the next several
minutes speaking with them about the combined power of diet and exercise.
But for the majority of these women at this age, what I had been taught, and
what had worked for me in the past, stopped working. They had fought for
years to shed stubborn weight, without much permanent success. I’m sorry
that it took having this same thing happen to me to change my tune, but
that’s the truth. When my own good advice didn’t help me, it really hit me
that I was doing something wrong.
I then threw myself into researching weight management and human
metabolism—specifically as they relate to women. Medical school and my
OB-GYN residency had taught us “calories in/calories out” as the only way,
but clearly there had to be another. I didn’t have all the answers, but I
wanted them—so I could feel better myself and then I could guide and
teach women how to reach the weight, the energy level, and the good health
they want and deserve. I yearned to understand why we have such a tough
time losing weight and keeping it off, especially as we approach and enter
midlife.
My deep passion for finding answers, combined with motivation and
determination, took me to some unexpected and exciting places. What kept
popping up in the research were three themes: intermittent fasting, anti-
inflammatory nutrition to help manage our hormonal changes, and
important new science on the exact ratios of protein, carbohydrates, and fat
we need to consume to burn fat.
Could these be the keys?
I decided to create my own plan using these three principles. That’s when
my individual health journey began. I tried out the newly minted diet on
myself first. I focused on timing first and then gradually started intermittent
fasting. After I mastered that, I focused on content: I began to eat more
protein and fiber. I used olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds as my principal
sources of fat. I steered clear of refined, processed carbohydrates (no more
Goldfish crackers!). I restricted foods and ingredients like artificial colors
and flavors that promote inflammation and disrupt the gut. What I never did
was count calories. Next, I further refined the macronutrient percentages to
supply more fat, moderate amounts of protein, and fewer carbohydrates.
Within several months, I lost those 20 pounds—especially around my
abdomen. I was ecstatic but quickly realized the weight loss was just a
pleasant side effect. More important, I felt healthier, stronger, and more

energetic. My hot flashes dramatically diminished, and I was sleeping
better.
I was on to something, so I asked my friends to try it. As I had been, they
also were amazed about the pounds and inches they were losing. Best of all,
they agreed this was easy. We didn’t feel hungry all the time. No cravings.
No terrible feelings of deprivation or restriction.
Next, I made copies of this three-tiered plan and handed them out to my
patients. There were the same results: weight loss, fewer menopause
symptoms, and more energy. Plus, they were keeping the lost pounds off,
something they’d never been able to do on any of their many previous diets.
After seeing these success stories, I felt it was time to share my plan with
a wider audience. I launched the initial program on Facebook for free and
asked volunteers to try it. Word then spread that people were losing
significant amounts of weight, including belly fat. I then wanted everyone
to have access to its secrets and experience its success.
I further formalized the plan and took it to an even broader audience
through an online program. Not sure of what would happen, I noticed that
women began enrolling in the plan, week after week, and we were off and
running. I have to admit, I was astonished to see how popular the program
had become in such a short time. It was the medical diet everyone was
talking about.
Enrollment in the program further skyrocketed, and to date, the plan has
now helped tens of thousands of women shed unwanted pounds, shrink
their waistlines, and improve their health.
I named my diet after Galveston, a coastal resort town in Texas. Although
I wasn’t born there, my husband and I have raised our daughters in
Galveston. I call it home, and it is where I’ve spent much of my medical
career. Now it is the birthplace of The Galveston Diet!
After the program took off, I wanted to further sharpen my nutrition
knowledge. I enrolled in the prestigious Culinary Medicine Program at
Tulane University, in Louisiana. It educates and trains doctors and other
medical professions to understand and apply medical nutrition principles in
a practical manner. That way, we can help our patients with nutritional
modifications that improve their health.
Sixty hours of coursework and many hands-on labs later, I was certified
in 2019 as a Culinary Medicine Specialist. The experience solidified and
affirmed that I was on the right path with what I had developed for The

Galveston Diet, particularly the importance of anti-inflammatory nutrition.
The course also emphasized something that really stuck with me: Nutrition
is the most under-utilized medication, yet it is the most effective.
So here I am today, humbled and gratified that so many women are
finally achieving what they’ve always wanted: a beautifully fit body on the
outside and an incredibly healthy one on the inside.
The Galveston Diet and You
This book expands my online program with new information and strategies.
These new features include help for detoxing from sugar, new insights into
menopause issues, the importance of certain under-appreciated nutrients,
new science behind how macronutrients support midlife health, completely
new recipes, brand-new meal plans, a maintenance plan, and other
information you can’t get online.
Even if you’ve worked through the online program, this book will be a
helpful guide and resource for you as you continue your Galveston Diet
journey. And if you’re new to my program, welcome! You now have an
opportunity to gain a 360-degree experience to achieve long-term weight
loss and make a happy, healthy transition through perimenopause and
menopause to postmenopause.
And, for both new and online students, this book will help you get to
know your body and teach you how to treat it like a loving friend. You’ll
achieve peace of mind, knowing how to form new habits that give you joy
and better health, and that work with your body to make you look strong,
lean, and beautiful.
My plan is not the typical diet—the 21 or 30 days and you’re done
approach that you see so often now. Not at all! Although many women
come to the program to lose weight safely and steadily, my main goal is that
you use it every single day permanently—a total lifestyle change.
With that goal in mind and staying true to the principles that worked so
well for me initially, I have designed three components of The Galveston
Diet. They are essentially health-promoting actions that make the program
work for you because they lead to good habit formation. All habits are built
from actions, learning, and repetition, so that the behavior becomes
automatic. In other words, you do it without much thinking. To develop
good habits, you’ll work on these three actions at the same time:

1. Intermittent fasting. This practice has enormous benefits for women
in terms of hormone balance, metabolism, and lowering inflammation. Of
all the components of the program, this is the one that moves the needle for
most women. They’ve told me they felt best after learning how to fast
intermittently.
On the Galveston Diet, you’ll do something called the 16:8 form of
intermittent fasting: 16 hours of fasting with an eating window of 8 hours. I
prefer this method because the fasting window is overnight. That means
you sleep for many of those 16 hours (ideally half of them)! So, it becomes
an easy habit to form.
2. Anti-inflammatory nutrition. The underlying issue in many diseases,
chronic inflammation triggers weight gain. But weight gain also triggers
inflammation, so they feed off each other in a crazy cycle. Inflammation
tends to get worse in women as we age and experience menopausal
hormone fluctuations. A lot of the foods we eat don’t help, either, because
they create inflammation throughout the body. Yet it doesn’t have to be this
way. There are many foods that actually fight inflammation. The Galveston
Diet focuses on limiting the pro-inflammatory foods and increasing the
anti-inflammatory foods.
3. Fuel refocus. For consistent, lasting weight loss, your body must shift
its energy usage to rely more on fat as its fuel, rather than on glucose
(which is generally supplied by carb-heavy diets). If you don’t burn all the
glucose you have in your bloodstream, the excess is stored as body fat. This
metabolic fact led me to create a nutritional protocol made up of 70 percent
healthy fats, 20 percent lean protein, and 10 percent quality carbohydrates.
This ratio accomplishes three major metabolic feats: It encourages the body
to burn fat. It trains the body to break the addiction to sugar and processed
carbs. And it refocuses your eating on healthy sources of fats, protein, and
carbohydrates.
Later, as you’re ready to start maintenance, I’ll introduce you to the
Galveston Diet for Life program, in which you gradually decrease the fat
percentage and increase the carbohydrate percentage, ultimately stabilizing
at 40 percent fat, 20 percent protein, and 40 percent carbohydrates for
lifetime success.
By the time you’re well into all three actions, your body is beginning to
burn fat more easily, and it will stop depositing fat in undesirable places
like your abdomen. Accordingly, you could lose a tremendous amount of

weight on the program. Kelli is a good example. She started the Galveston
Diet and stuck with it, month after month. She ended up losing 100 pounds!
She also trimmed 14½ inches off her waist and 9½ inches off her hips. But
along with the weight loss, Kelli also noticed dramatic improvements in her
sleep patterns, energy level, and digestive function, as well as decreased
menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and a greater feeling of overall
wellness.
Here’s the big secret behind why the Galveston Diet is so effective: All
three components work together synergistically to give you the best results.
You have to intermittent-fast to lower inflammation and start to burn fat.
You can’t just fast, and still eat the standard American diet of inflammatory
foods, then expect to burn fat and keep it off. You have to nourish your
body with a great variety of anti-inflammatory foods. And you have to
refocus your macronutrient choices to include more fat, moderate protein,
and healthy carbohydrates.
Maybe you’re wondering how long this diet takes to return you to great
health? Well, the answer is pretty simple: There is no set amount of time;
everyone loses weight and regains health at a different pace. But more
important than that, remember and understand that the Galveston Diet is not
a diet in the conventional sense of the word. It is a lifestyle.
Please don’t be discouraged that this is a forever plan. Once you learn to
live and eat this way, it becomes second nature to do so, and those old,
health-harming habits—of reaching for fast food or sugar-laden carbs all the
time—will become things of the past.
Yes, the Galveston Diet starts with a tightly orchestrated four-week plan
to help you change the way you eat, but that is only the beginning. To help
you stay with it forever, you’ll transition to the Galveston Diet for Life
program, which I cover in the final chapter. Most books present nutrition
plans that are short term, with no guidance on what to do after you’ve
followed the plan for several weeks. They leave you hanging, tempted to
return to your old, unhealthy ways of eating (along with a frustrating return
of pounds!). But with this maintenance program, that won’t happen. It is a
plan that shows you how to put additional anti-inflammatory foods back
into your lifestyle, change your macro percentages to include less fat and
more carbohydrates, and use intermittent fasting as the powerful weight-
maintaining tool that it is.

Keep in mind that the word diet comes from the Greek word dieta,
meaning “to live normally.” However, nowadays the word mostly refers to
cutting calories, even entire food groups, to help weight loss rather than a
way to enjoy food and health. The Galveston Diet will help you lose weight
and keep it off for sure, and this is critically important to health because
weight gain contributes to many chronic and serious conditions in women.
But the Galveston Diet, along with its maintenance plan, is primarily an
eating pattern in the original sense of the world—a way of life—that
promotes long-lasting health.
If you follow the Galveston Diet and change the way you live, you’ll
ultimately find, like I did, that weight loss is only one great benefit. (By the
way, you can do this plan even if you are happy with your weight. I’m at a
healthy weight now, and I live this way all the time.) There are so many
more benefits besides weight loss: fewer menopause symptoms, blood
sugar control, normalized blood lipid ranges, quality sleep, better gut
health, greater energy, smoother skin, and more. You’ll just feel better
overall. Remember, The Galveston Diet is not a temporary stop on your
journey. It is the journey! There may be ups and downs. You may take a few
steps back before you charge ahead, but that’s okay. This is ultimately a
forward journey, and you’re on this path to take better care of you. Just
solidly commit yourself to moving down this path, and you will see your
life and health change. I’m so happy to be on this journey with you.

CHAPTER 1
Your Changing Body, Your Changing Needs
To say that my own transition from perimenopause to menopause was
grueling would be an understatement. It turned out to be hell, pure and
simple—with hot flashes, night sweats, thinning hair, dry skin, and weight
gain. I was so ready to be done with it all.
But now that I look back, I see things that were not clear to me at the
time. I wish I had known, for example, that symptoms can begin in your
thirties, that if I had started hormone replacement therapy earlier, I could
have been a whole lot more comfortable, and that mental states like
moodiness, depression, or anxiety do not mean we’re crazy!
Yes, your body is changing, but this is a normal part of life that all of us
women go through—mainly brought on by hormonal fluctuations. This
time of physical flux is categorized as three stages: perimenopause,
menopause, and postmenopause. We experience these in unique ways. Let’s
take a look at what happens in each stage.
Perimenopause
In your mid- to late thirties or early forties, it may seem like your body is
morphing right before your eyes. You may notice—and be irritated by—the
discovery that your clothes don’t fit as well as they used to, even if you
haven’t gained any weight. Your skin becomes drier. A few wrinkles are
visible. You look and feel more tired than when you were younger. It’s like
seeing a stranger in the mirror.
If these changes are happening to you, you’re most likely entering the
first stage of hormonal fluctuation—perimenopause. This is a natural period
of transition that begins several years before menopause. It can last from a
few months to up to 10 years prior to menopause, and it is your body’s
natural transition to making less estrogen. As your ovaries produce less
estrogen, your periods become irregular. You may start to skip periods.

Eventually, your monthly cycle will stop completely. Once you’ve gone a
year without having a period, you’ve reached full menopause.
Symptoms in Perimenopause
Every woman’s experience is unique. Some women have no symptoms or
simply a few minor ones, while others experience a wide range of
symptoms that can be quite severe. Symptoms begin in perimenopause but
can continue into menopause. Fortunately, by the time you hit
postmenopause, the major issues have all but vanished. Here is a look at the
symptoms that begin in perimenopause and often persist into menopause:
Weight gain. This might be the symptom that brought you to this book!
Whereas once you used to rip through nachos, candy bars, and
cheeseburgers—and remain a size 4—now a few potato chips might force
you into a larger dress size and elastic-waist pants become your new BFF.
When the pounds start inexplicably piling on, this is due mostly to the
effects of changing hormones on appetite and metabolism, as well as those
hormones that control how and where we store fat. This excess weight can
increase and worsen other symptoms, such as night sweats and hot flashes,
muscle and joint problems, and bladder issues.
The increase in hot flashes, in particular, has been chalked up to what
researchers term the “thermoregulatory theory.” If you carry more body fat
on your frame relative to muscle, that body fat is insulating your body,
making it harder to dissipate heat. Your body then retains that heat, and it
can’t be distributed. The result is more severe hot flashes.
Much of this has been substantiated in research. A 2017 study uncovered
clear evidence that women who are overweight or obese have a more
difficult menopause, with more night sweats and hot flashes. In addition,
other symptoms like joint pain, muscle pain, vaginal dryness, and urinary
incontinence and other bladder symptoms were worse in women with
excess weight.
Another challenge for women in midlife has to do with visceral fat,
which wraps around our organs. I call this the “menopause middle.” It is
caused by the rising activity of our circulating androgens (testosterone and
others). Visceral fat is marked by an increasing waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).
The WHR calculation is the ratio of your waist circumference to your hip
circumference, and this gives a pretty fair indication of how much fat is
stored on your waist, hips, and buttocks.

Aside from affecting the way we look (and how we feel about it), visceral
fat is associated with increased risk for serious conditions like heart disease,
breast cancer, uterine cancer, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, sleep apnea,
and many other troubling diseases.
The point here is that if you can get your weight under control, you can
go a long way toward easing many of the most severe symptoms of
perimenopause and menopause—plus reduce your risk factors for many of
these scary illnesses. Excess fat in midlife is not only a cosmetic concern
but also an issue that can gravely affect health.
Hot flashes. You’re all dressed up, you’ve done your hair, you’ve got
your makeup on, when suddenly—wham. Here comes an intense heat
whooshing through your upper torso and face. It might last anywhere from
a few seconds to many minutes, but you’re ready to strip down, right then
and there. Some women have hot flashes once or twice a month, while
others experience them daily. Nighttime hot flashes (night sweats) might
wake you up, interrupt your sleep, and then make you feel weary and
sluggish during the day.
Hair loss and changes. Your hair changes as you go through midlife. It
usually thins out over parts of your scalp, as opposed to developing obvious
bald patches. Also, your hair may fall out in big clumps when you brush or
shower.
Hair loss during midlife is caused primarily by a hormonal imbalance
that is specifically linked to the decline in estrogen, as well as the rise in the
activity of testosterone. Hair grows more quickly and stays on your head
longer when estrogen is abundant and testosterone activity is relatively low.
And where on Earth did those whiskers on your face and chin come
from? Blame it also on the rising activity of testosterone.
Insomnia. Your sleep patterns may now resemble those of a newborn.
You’re up every two hours. You’re hungry. And you have to pee. You toss
and turn for hours each night, hoping that your mind will shut off and let
you go to sleep.
You may be experiencing insomnia (difficulty falling asleep), or perhaps
you wake up earlier than normal. Sweaty nights might also make it difficult
to sleep.
Again, the culprit here is hormonal fluctuations. Your estrogen and
progesterone levels are going up and down.

Memory loss and brain fog. You know that feeling when you’re trying
to remember something, and the word is right on the tip of your tongue? Or,
you find yourself standing in the middle of the room and have no idea how
you got there or what you’re supposed to be doing? Or, you’ve repeated the
same story to your husband or kids a couple of times already this week?
This might be you 24/7 these days. This condition is often referred to as
brain fog, and it’s common during perimenopause and menopause because
your body is producing less estrogen.
Vaginal and bladder problems. With the drop in estrogen levels, your
vaginal walls become drier, thinner, and less elastic. I know one woman
who described this dryness as feeling like her vagina had grown cobwebs!
These changes may lead to pain and discomfort during intercourse. You
may be more susceptible to vaginal infections when your estrogen levels are
low.
Because of the proximity of the bladder to the vagina, the thinning of the
vaginal wall affects the bladder, too. A loss of tissue tone may cause urinary
incontinence and frequent bladder infections.
Sexual changes. Our sex lives—like life itself—are changeable based on
many different situations. One such situation is the dip in female hormones
during midlife. This change has many ramifications, including a decrease in
sexual arousal and desire. However, if you were sexually frisky before
menopause, you’ll probably continue to have a healthy sex drive now. And
if you wonder about sex after age 50 or 60 or beyond, the most important
thing to remember is your sex life can and will last a lifetime—if you want
it to!
Mood shifts. Irritable doesn’t begin to describe it, right? Your emotions
frequently spiral out of control at the least little thing, and you can’t seem to
control your mood swings and temper. Couple this with being tired
(because you were woken up by hot flashes) and the problems are
compounded. For many women, this is the worst symptom simply because
you suddenly feel so not like yourself.
Yet again, one big reason for this change is your estrogen level. Estrogen
controls how much serotonin is being produced in your brain. Serotonin is a
chemical that helps regulate your moods. If you’re producing less estrogen,
you’re also producing less serotonin. This can have a direct impact on how
stable and optimistic you feel.

If you’re dealing with mood shifts, remember that your body is changing
and you aren’t to blame for these emotions. It’s also important that you
explain the physiology of this particular symptom to your partner so that he
or she can be more patient and understanding of, well, your impatience!
Other symptoms. Many other symptoms crop up during perimenopause,
and very seldom are you warned about them. For example:
Breast pain
Dry and/or itchy skin
Palpitations
Panic attacks
Constipation
Dizziness
Dry mouth
Urinary incontinence
Rage
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Dry eyes
Light-headedness
Headaches or migraines
The food and lifestyle strategies of the Galveston Diet will help you
combat weight gain and other symptoms during perimenopause.
Menopause
After perimenopause comes menopause—the stage during which your
ovaries stop producing reproductive hormones and you have no monthly
periods for 12 consecutive months. Although the average age for starting
menopause is 51, it is normal to experience it as early as 45 and as late as
55.
In menopause, weight gain can become even more pronounced—and
frustrating to shed. On average, women gain between 12 and 15 pounds
during the ages of 45 through 55. You’ll experience more intense hunger
signals, too, which make you want to eat more food and which necessarily
increase your chances of putting on pounds.

What’s more, other metabolic problems crop up at this time, including
insulin resistance and disturbances in metabolizing glucose and fats. The
risk of developing type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, and cancer
increases, too.
An important study looked into how diet affects women when they enter
menopause. It tracked 35,000 women for four years, and the results were
astounding. Those whose diets were high in processed carbs, such as rice,
pasta, potato chips, and pretzels, experienced menopause 1½ years sooner,
on average, than those women whose diet mainly consisted of fish and
vitamin-rich foods (leafy vegetables, fruits, eggs, and so forth).
Why did women with the high intake of processed carbs hit menopause
earlier? The researchers speculated that the high carbs spiked levels of
circulating insulin, which probably caused insulin resistance and interfered
with sex hormone activity.
The findings of this study give fair warning: Developing and maintaining
healthy eating patterns sooner rather than later is critical to your health and
menopause experience in midlife. That’s what you’re going to do on the
Galveston Diet!
Unfortunately, a number of other health risks are associated with
menopause, too. Before menopause, the estrogen generated by the ovaries
protected us from heart attacks and strokes. Women lose a lot of this
protection after menopause because less estrogen is produced. Midlife also
brings other risk factors for heart disease, such as excessive cholesterol,
high blood pressure, and a lack of physical activity,
You’ll learn how to ease, manage, and even stop these symptoms once
you’re well into the Galveston Diet program.
The Joy of Change
Sandra had been overweight by 40 to 50 pounds her entire life.
When she turned 50, she decided it was time to get healthy.
Frustrated by her lifelong struggle with her weight, Sandra fully
embraced the Galveston Diet. She told us, “I could not believe the
changes I’ve experienced.”
Sandra lost 55 pounds and got down to a fit 120 pounds for the
first time ever. Not only is the Galveston Diet effective for weight
loss, but it also eases the symptoms of menopause. In Sandra’s

case, she found she was sleeping better and feeling more energized
than she had in 20 years. She also no longer suffered back pain.
“I feel amazing!”
Postmenopause
Postmenopause is the stage of life after you have not had a period for 12
months or longer. During this stage, your cells may store even more fat and
are slower to release it. Postmenopausal women have an almost five times
higher risk of developing visceral fat, compared to premenopausal women.
Also, you may have less muscle mass, which makes your metabolism
slow down, and your body doesn’t burn calories as efficiently as it once did.
Once you are postmenopausal, your hormone levels will remain at a
constant low level.
I must point out that there are several health complications associated
with postmenopause. To stay healthy in this phase of life, understand these
conditions and their risk factors. That way, you can engage in ways,
including good nutrition, to reduce your risk.
Osteoporosis. This is a medical issue that causes the thinning of your
bones and makes you susceptible to bone fractures, particularly in the hips,
spine, and wrists. Losses in bone density increase following menopause.
You may lose up to 25 percent of your bone density up to age 60. This
occurs because the amount of estrogen is declining in your body.
Osteoporosis affects one of every three postmenopausal women, and their
remaining lifetime risk of fragility fractures is greater than the risk of
developing breast cancer.
Even if you have been diagnosed with osteoporosis, you are not
powerless. There are many treatments for it, and one of the best is to do
weight-bearing exercises like resistance training. I love weight training. Not
only does it make the muscles fit, but it also strengthens the bones. Your
bones need to be resisting the force of gravity for the exercise to help in the
prevention of further bone loss. Nutrition is key, too, and the Galveston Diet
gives you what you need.
Cardiovascular disease. One of the biggest medical myths is that
cardiovascular disease is a man’s disease. It’s the number one health threat
for American women, especially during menopause and in postmenopause.

Menopause doesn’t directly cause cardiovascular disease, but it may
increase your risk of developing it. When the level of your hormones
declines, the risk factors for heart trouble increase. You may develop high
blood pressure, elevated LDL cholesterol (the unhealthy type), and a rise in
triglycerides following menopause. According to the American Heart
Association, one in three women will develop cardiovascular disease during
menopause. There’s also an increase in the incidence of heart attacks for
women 10 years after menopause.
The Joy of Change
The Galveston Diet has been known to help women with high
blood pressure. On the program, some people can even reduce their
medication use (with permission from their physicians). Lesia is
one of those people. Her medication was cut in half, which allowed
her to maintain the same or better control of her blood pressure.
This situation often occurs with weight loss, especially with a
reduction in visceral fat—which is what happened to Lesia. She
lost several inches around her waist and is now wearing a single-
digit pant size.
Depression and other mental health conditions. In postmenopause, the
risk of developing depression appears to be greater than it is earlier in life.
This most likely is due not only to a hormonal decline but also to major life
changes during the postmenopausal years that can bring on depression, such
as having the children leave home, the divorce or death of a spouse,
stressful retirement planning, age-related health problems, and so forth.
A 2019 study looked into the frequency of depression in 371
premenopausal and postmenopausal women who were not on hormone
replacement therapy. Just 21 percent of the premenopausal group
experienced only mild depression, whereas nearly 60 percent of the
postmenopausal women were suffering major depression (which is more
dangerous than mild depression and requires urgent medical care).
If you’re depressed, you may feel sad, irritable, and unmotivated, or
sense you have bleak prospects for the future. You may feel like you’re
dragging yourself through the day. Normal, day-to-day activities may take

longer and give you no satisfaction. Changes like these in your mental
health should always be discussed with your doctor. Depression is highly
treatable, and you do not have to live with it.
More severe vaginal dryness. Vaginal dryness typically begins in
perimenopause, continues through menopause, and can become more
severe in postmenopause. The vaginal walls shrink and thin as you get
older, due to changes in hormone production. As the estrogen levels drop,
less moisture is secreted by cells with thinner walls. This can lead to painful
intercourse, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) or vaginal infections,
and worsening incontinence.
There’s no need to experience a sexual drought because of vaginal issues,
including dryness. I’m a big believer in using a vaginal lubricant, and
plenty of it. Many over-the-counter lubricants can be used to relieve dryness
and pain in the vaginal region. They work by affecting the pH of the vaginal
area, which also lowers the risk of a UTI. Be sure to select a lubricant
designed exclusively for vaginal use. Avoid products with perfumes, herbal
extracts, and artificial colors. (My favorite brands of lubricants are
Uberlube and KY Silk-E.) Start using a lubricant well before you hit this
stage of life, however, and you can keep feeling sensual and sexy—and
make sex even more fun and intimate.
Also, consider talking to your doctor about a prescription for estrogen
treatment in the form of a cream or ring that releases estrogen directly into
the tissues in order to increase vaginal moisture.
The nutrition and lifestyle strategies you’ll learn on the Galveston Diet
will go a long way toward making your postmenopause years healthier and
more satisfying,

Three Strategies for Turning Things Around—The Galveston
Diet
Not only have I personally gone through the physiological changes
associated with perimenopause and menopause myself, but I have also
ushered roughly 100,000 women through the Galveston Diet online
program. All these experiences have helped me identify the secrets of
combating the seemingly inevitable, stubborn fat, including belly fat, plus
ways to resolve the health issues that plague women going through midlife.

Let’s recap the three key actions involved in the Galveston Diet—
strategies that you’ll initiate in your own life very soon.
1. Intermittent Fasting
As I noted in the Introduction, intermittent fasting is key to the diet,
especially during menopause. Even though it may seem intimidating, I
promise you it’s the easiest habit to develop and maintain!!
What is intermittent fasting? It is simply fasting for approximately 16
hours a day (much of it overnight) and then eating within a consecutive 8-
hour window. It has a long list of benefits for women in midlife, and I cover
this strategy in detail in Chapter 4.
2. Anti-Inflammatory Nutrition
Most of the time, inflammation in the body is a lifesaver. It empowers the
body to fight off various disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and other
pathogens. But sometimes, the whole feverish process doesn’t shut down on
cue, thereby having all sorts of health repercussions. For example,
inflammation in the body can cause weight gain and make it hard for you to
lose weight.
Fortunately, the Galveston Diet eases all this by cutting out foods that
promote inflammation and encouraging foods that fight it. Added and
simple sugars, as well as processed carbohydrates, are extremely
inflammatory. Not to be dramatic, but at all costs, limit your consumption
of these foods. It’s even better for your health, your symptoms, and your
weight to eliminate them altogether. Not only will doing so decrease the
severity of menopausal symptoms but it will also reduce the frequency of
them. That’s a win-win right there!
More on this in Chapter 5.
3. Fuel Refocus
If you’re otherwise healthy and eating a carbohydrate-centric diet, your
body burns those calories for energy and stores any excess as fat. But to
prevent fat storage and stimulate fat-burning, you must deplete the carbs.
During the Fuel Refocus phase of the Galveston Diet, you’ll adjust the
ratios of macronutrients (protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fat)
so as to encourage your body to utilize fat for fuel. Your new ratio will be

70 percent healthy fats, 20 percent lean protein, and 10 percent
carbohydrates.
Refocusing your fuel like this does not mean you’re following a keto
diet. Traditional keto diets are extremely inflammatory for most people—
which is why the Galveston Diet is not a keto diet. It focuses on lowering
inflammation rather than promoting it.
The major caveat here is something delved into in Chapter 7: how to be
picky with your carbohydrates. Choose those that are packed with fiber,
vitamins, and antioxidants: quinoa, oats, sweet potatoes, blueberries, and
apples are great examples of anti-inflammatory carbs.
When you start the Galveston Diet for Life program—which is a
maintenance plan—you again change your macronutrient ratios to allow
more carbohydrates and less fat. Ultimately, you’ll refocus your macros to
40 percent fat, 20 percent protein, and 40 percent carbohydrates—and
stabilize there.
The Joy of Change
When Paula came to the Galveston Diet, she was a desperate
woman, having struggled with her weight since high schooI,
suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in her twenties,
and surviving thyroid cancer in her thirties.
Nothing she tried had helped her drop pounds, and by her
forties, she was gaining even more weight. She had just about
given up. Paula is a firefighter who knows the importance of being
healthy and staying in shape—but all this had eluded her until she
started the Galveston Diet.
She said this about her experience: “I started intermittent fasting,
eating anti-inflammatory foods, and counting my macros in order
to refocus my fuel. The weight just started falling off. It seemed
too easy! My endocrinologist cut my metformin for PCOS in half
and thinks I can go off it completely. I truly believe this diet has
healed the insulin resistance I’ve struggled with for over 20 years. I
believe it prevented a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.”
Support from friends and loved ones is so important when
you’re changing your lifestyle. Paula’s husband followed the

program right along with her and lost 50 pounds himself.
She added, “I can’t tell you how this has changed our lives. It is
definitely a way of life for us now.”
Hot Flash: Don’t Neglect Regular Exercise
As part of the Galveston Diet lifestyle, I strongly encourage a mix
of strength training and regular cardio (fast walking, jogging,
cardio machines—whatever you enjoy). Don’t be afraid of
weights! Even light ones help. Our muscles naturally shrink a bit
through an aging process called sarcopenia. If we’re not doing
weight-bearing exercise, we lose muscle mass, and this slows
down our metabolism. The net effect—you guessed it—is
unexplained weight gain! Also, performing cardio and weight-
bearing exercises will keep you burning calories for longer after
your workout, so that’s another win-win.
Move Forward with the Right Attitude
Throughout our lives, we women pass through beautiful gateways. Getting
our period is the gateway to womanhood; for some, becoming pregnant and
then having children is the gateway to motherhood. Both are seen as
miraculous wins, while menopause is commonly described as a loss—a loss
of fertility, of beauty, of sexuality, and of self-worth.
But I would argue that menopause is the gateway to a new life that
carries a large upside. Forty percent of a woman’s life is spent in
postmenopause. Let that sink in for a moment.
Imagine what you can do with all that time! Menopause tends to coincide
with a time when your children—if you have them—are launching or have
launched adult lives of their own. This means you have more time for
yourself, with an opportunity to reimagine your future life. You have time
to uncover and embrace your passions—start a new business, devote your
energies to a cause, write, pursue art, spend more time with family and
friends, enjoy nature, run for office, or follow whatever interest matters to
you. Anything!

Along those lines, consider menopause to be a privilege. It means you’ve
lived a long time—an opportunity many others don’t enjoy, for one reason
or another. For example, I celebrate my birthday in a big way each year
because I’m so grateful to be here—even if that means a few wrinkles,
some gray hair, and creaky joints.
So, view this period as a time to learn more about yourself. Instead of
feeling bad about this phase of life and being upset with the symptoms, be
intentional about your choices. Learn more about your body and what does
and doesn’t work for you, whether it’s food, exercise, or relationships—and
then focus on the positives rather than the negatives. If you can reframe the
way you think about menopause, and you live the principles in the
Galveston Diet, this can be an amazing time in your life.




CHAPTER 2
Getting a Handle on Your Hormones
For far too long, we’ve been fed the lie that losing weight and keeping it off
is simply a matter of willpower. Grit your teeth, white knuckle it, and off go
the pounds. But if you “fall off the diet wagon,” you’re a failure.
Here’s the truth: you’re not a failure. You didn’t fail any of the diets you
tried; those diets failed you. Your past issues with losing weight and
keeping it off are not your fault. And they have very little to do with
willpower.
The real issue is hormones. Hormones and metabolic factors connected to
them are the reason we tend to put on pounds during midlife.
When you have trouble losing weight, you feel frustrated and powerless,
sometimes beating yourself up for failing at dieting. This creates a vicious
cycle of weight loss and weight gain, with lots of unnecessary emotional
pressure involved. But weight gain has nothing to do with you, your moral
character, or your personality. Repeat after me: it’s hormones!
The Flawed Science of Weight Gain
For nearly a century, the cause of weight gain and obesity has been
described as “an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories
expended,” to quote the World Health Organization. In other words, obesity
is an energy-balance disorder: calories in minus calories out = fat loss. I
believed this, too. It was what I was taught in medical school and residency.
As it turns out, this line of thinking has been proven by modern obesity
research to be largely inadequate.
Fortunately, this entire paradigm is now being challenged. A major study
published in 2020 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and
authored by many of the leading scientists in obesity clearly points out that
obesity is not an energy-balance disorder but, rather, a hormonal disorder

that dictates fat storage and metabolism regardless of how many calories
you eat.
In plain language, your weight is controlled largely by hormones, which
in turn are influenced dramatically by the quality of the nutrition you
consume (particularly carbohydrates) and less by the quantity of the food
you eat. You don’t only put on weight because you eat too much or take in
more calories than you burn. You also gain weight because the
carbohydrates in your diet—both the quantity of carbs and their quality—
establish a hormonal environment that makes you pile on fat pounds. Plus,
as women, we deal with declining estrogen levels as we get older, and we
find new fat accumulating around our waistlines—no matter how much
rabbit food we eat or treadmill miles we log!
The Joy of Change
All her life, Steph had a terrible time losing weight, and every
attempt had failed spectacularly. Trying to rely on willpower, she
followed low-fat, food pyramids, calorie counting, carb lovers—
you name the diet, she did it.
Even more scary, her weight had contributed to some serious
health issues. Five years ago, she was diagnosed as pre-diabetic
and hypertensive. Both conditions could worsen if she did not
make lifestyle changes.
Steph was prompted into action, fortunately, after looking at
some family vacation photos on her phone. She did not like her
overweight appearance; in fact, she was shocked at how much
weight she had put on.
Steph found out about the Galveston Diet—and was intrigued. It
bore no resemblance to anything she had tried. It was geared to
regulating hormonal weight gain by nutritionally shifting your fuel
sources away from too many carbs and inflammatory foods.
Steph began following the Galveston Diet—and met with great
success.
“I am down over 60 pounds in eight months. It has not only
helped me lose the weight I so desperately needed to lose, but I am

no longer pre-diabetic, and I am no longer on blood pressure
medication. I feel better than I have in over 20 years.”
You and Your Hormones
Hormones are your body’s chemical messengers. Dozens of glands and
organs—including the gut, ovaries, adrenal glands, and brain—are pumping
out various hormones all the time. They act on cells throughout the body,
telling them how to behave. And they’re constantly chatting with one
another and other compounds in the body to stay in balance.
When it comes to your weight and other perimenopause and menopause
symptoms, hormones are running the show. They control appetite, hunger,
food cravings, metabolic rate, fat gain and distribution, and hunger, among
other things. If certain hormones are out of whack, your weight-loss efforts
can be sabotaged. What’s more, and as outlined in Chapter 1, suboptimal
levels of certain hormones are linked not only to obesity but also to chronic
inflammation, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and more.
Fortunately, regulating your hormones helps prevent weight gain and
fights inflammation. The power to do all this is in your hands—with the
nutritionally based strategies you’ll learn in The Galveston Diet.
The key to resolving hormonal weight gain and other midlife symptoms
comes down to nine hormones—and managing them primarily through
nutrition.
Estrogen
Estrogen is the primary female sex hormone most closely associated with
perimenopause and menopause. Estrogen is an umbrella term for three
chemically similar hormones: estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Their main job
is to orchestrate the expression of female sex characteristics and to regulate
the menstrual cycle. Estrogen also allows body fat to be distributed on the
thighs, buttocks, and abdomen. During your reproductive years, additional
fat deposited in these locations provides an energy source for eventual
pregnancy and lactation.
This hormone affects your health in many other ways, too. For example:
It helps build your bones and maintain bone strength.
It helps control cholesterol levels.

It increases blood supply to the skin and regulates the thickness of the
skin.
It keeps the pelvic floor and vaginal and bladder tissues strong and
healthy.
It helps even out your moods and may manage anxiety and depression.
As we enter midlife, our estrogen begins to fluctuate greatly. When the
ovaries begin to decrease the production of estrogen in perimenopause, the
body ramps up the production of follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) to
try to get the ovaries to produce more estrogen. This leads to some of the
wild fluctuations of estrogen during perimenopause.
As estrogen levels decline during the transition to menopause, the liver
begins to decrease the production of sex hormone-binding globulin
(SHBG). SHBG binds our sex hormones and renders them inactive. As
SHBG levels drop, the activity of our sex hormones, particularly androgens
(like testosterone), increases. This chain of hormonal events leads to
changes in cholesterol, visceral fat gain, and unwanted hair growth.
How the Galveston Diet Helps Manage Estrogen
When you get to the food recommendations in Chapter 7, you’ll see a heavy
focus on cruciferous and green vegetables, as well as on avocados, salmon,
and seeds. All these foods help offset the effects of your fluctuating
estrogen. Here’s how:
Cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, broccoli sprouts, Brussels sprouts,
and cauliflower, are tightly linked to estrogen. Research shows that women
who eat a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables have a lower risk of heart
disease, stroke, and cancer, and overall better hormone and estrogen levels.
One of the problems experienced by many women in midlife is that they
have excess estrogen in their bodies, rather than too little. If this has
happened to you, your body is not ovulating regularly, leading to unopposed
estrogen production and little to no progesterone production. Or your body
is not breaking down estrogen and removing it from your body as it should.
Having excess body fat can also lead to high estrogen levels, as androgens
are converted to estrogen in our fat cells.
Other causes include drinking too much alcohol; having liver problems,
in which your body cannot properly metabolize estrogen; or being
overexposed to synthetic “xenoestrogens,” which are chemicals found in

the environment that act like estrogen once they’re inside your body. The
latter can increase your estrogen levels.
One of the ways to combat high estrogen is to eat more cruciferous
vegetables. These vegetables contain a phytochemical called
diindolylmethane (DIM) that helps rid the body of excess estrogen.
Cruciferous vegetables also contain sulfur compounds that help detoxify a
sluggish liver, which can trigger weight gain, bloating, gas, and
constipation.
Leafy greens also contain DIM, as well as chemicals such as indole-3-
carbinol (I3C) and calcium D-glucarate, all of which help increase the
liver’s ability to clear estrogen metabolites (these are the by-products of
estrogen metabolism) from the body.
Avocados are packed with healthy fats, which are associated with
balancing progesterone and estrogen.
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids can help support estrogen production.
Salmon in particular contains optimal amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.
Flax seeds and pumpkin seeds contain dietary lignans that help inhibit
enzymes involved in healthy estrogen metabolism. Lignans are plant
nutrients that are high in fiber. They also serve as antioxidants that support
your immune system. What’s more, lignans are excellent for managing
hormone levels in the body, particularly estrogen.
Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc, essential fats, and protein, making them
one of the best foods to help balance estrogen.
Insulin
Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas in response to how many
carbohydrates you eat. It has many functions, but insulin’s main job is to
allow your cells to take in sugar from your blood and store it for energy
(depending on what is needed).
Another of insulin’s vital roles in the body relates to fat storage. It
obstructs the breakdown of fat tissue and stimulates the creation of body fat.
So, if you are overweight, diabetic, or predisposed to diabetes, you must
normalize your insulin levels as much as possible to prevent fat storage and
to manage your weight. An important solution is to restrict your intake of
carbohydrates, especially refined carbs and added sugar.
As we age and develop more visceral fat (belly fat), insulin resistance
(IR) can develop, meaning it takes more insulin than normal to “push”

sugar into the cells to do their job.
A diet rich in sugar, refined carbohydrates, and fast food drives insulin
resistance and therefore weight gain. One fascinating study found that
people who ate at fast-food restaurants habitually—twice a week or more—
gained weight and developed insulin resistance, suggesting that fast food
increases the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Hot Flash: Signs You May Be Insulin Resistant
You have extreme thirst or hunger.
You feel hungry even after a meal.
You experience frequent vaginal or bladder infections.
You have increased abdominal circumference and body fat.
You have to pee more often.
You get tingling in your hands and feet.
You’re getting skin tags.
You have dark, velvet patches on your neck and armpits—a
skin condition known as acanthosis nigricans.
How the Galveston Diet Helps Normalize Insulin Levels and Improve
Insulin Sensitivity
On the Galveston Diet, you’ll be changing your eating habits to naturally
manage your insulin levels and restore them to normal. Here’s what we’ll
concentrate on:
Limiting carbohydrates. Lower-carb diets have been proven to reduce
insulin levels and stabilize blood sugar levels. You’ll learn how to manage
your carbohydrates in the Fuel Refocus phase of the Galveston Diet.
Cutting back on or avoiding added or processed sugars. High
amounts of dietary fructose, in the form of high-fructose corn syrup and
sucrose, promote insulin resistance and raise insulin levels.
Enjoying ample protein at meals. Although insulin levels rise initially
after eating protein, the long-term effects of eating protein lead to decreases
in belly fat and, therefore, help prevent IR.
Serving up healthy fats. Foods rich in omega-3 fats, in particular, have
been found to help lower fasting insulin levels.

Boosting your fiber. It’s important to keep track of your total fiber
intake and ensure you are getting at least 25 grams daily (I shoot for 35
grams per day). It’s also important to obtain a combination of soluble and
insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber dissolves in water, forming a gel-like
substance that helps slow down digestion and the absorption of sugars.
Examples of soluble fiber–rich foods include lentils, nuts, oats, and certain
fruits and vegetables.
Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water, but it helps food move through
the digestive system more quickly. Examples of foods containing insoluble
fiber include vegetables and whole grains. As the name suggests, insoluble
fiber does not dissolve in water, which gives it the ability to remain fully
intact in the digestive tract. This allows it to add bulk to the stool and thus
have a laxative effect that can be used to treat digestive issues like
constipation.
Supplementing with magnesium. Insulin-resistant people are often
deficient in magnesium, so supplementing with this mineral can improve
insulin sensitivity. We’ll get into greater detail about importance of
magnesium in your diet in Chapter 7.
Eating antioxidant-rich foods. Colorful fruits and vegetables contain
antioxidants that fight inflammation and lead to lower insulin levels.
Flavoring foods with spices and herbs. I try to use various spices and
herbs in almost all my recipes. Some of the best flavorings I’ve found
include fenugreek (full of soluble fiber), turmeric (a powerful antioxidant
and inflammation fighter), ginger (improves the function of glucose
receptors on muscle cells), garlic (another powerful antioxidant), and
cinnamon (1 to 6 grams or ¼ to 1½ teaspoons daily for regulating blood
sugar).
Sipping green tea. Green tea is high in antioxidants that help fight
inflammation and increase insulin sensitivity.
Getting consistent exercise. Regular cardio exercise and resistance
training improve insulin sensitivity.
Leptin
Produced by fat cells, leptin is known as the “I’m full,” or the satiety,
hormone. It reduces the appetite and makes you feel full after eating.
What’s more, leptin tells your brain that there’s enough fat in storage and
that no more is needed, which helps prevent overeating.

Ironically, when you’re overweight, you probably have too much leptin
in your bloodstream—so much so that your body doesn’t register the “I’m
full” sensation. In fact, one study found that leptin levels in obese people
were four times higher than in people of a healthy weight.
A lack of sensitivity to leptin leads to a condition known as leptin
resistance. With leptin resistance, the brain can’t recognize leptin signals
and thus it drives cravings, unhealthy eating habits, and weight gain. A
vicious cycle can ensue. You eat more and put on body fat. More body fat
creates more leptin in the fat cells and elevates insulin levels. Excess body
fat disrupts the proper leptin signaling and thus worsens insulin resistance.
In essence, your brain thinks you’re starving, which makes you want to eat
more. You put on even more weight and yet feel hungrier, so you eat more
and gain even more fat. And on and on.
Hot Flash: Nix These Six Foods to Prevent Leptin
Resistance
Gaining visceral fat (belly fat) and eating a lot of high-fructose
corn syrup in processed foods are the two biggest reasons you
might be leptin resistant. To solve this problem and avoid leptin
resistance, get rid of the following foods in your diet:
Soft drinks
Sweetened fruit juices
Canned fruits
Boxed desserts
Flavored yogurt
Sugary breakfast cereals
How the Galveston Diet Helps Manage Leptin
Paying attention to your eating habits is critical for managing leptin, and it’s
actually easier than you think. Here’s how you can do that on the Galveston
Diet:
Avoid processed food. These foods may drive inflammation, which
causes leptin resistance.

Eat more fiber. It helps control your appetite, satiety, and weight.
Soluble fiber, in particular, can help improve your gut health.
Lower your triglycerides. This is the most common form of fat in the
bloodstream. Having high triglycerides can halt the transportation of leptin
from your blood to your brain, preventing the leptin’s fullness signal from
reaching your brain. The brain then thinks you’re starving and initiates
powerful mechanisms to make your body regain that lost fat. The best way
to lower triglycerides is to reduce your carbohydrate intake.
Focus on protein. Eating adequate protein can support weight loss,
resulting from an improvement in leptin sensitivity. As a woman, if you’re
eating three times a day, you should have at least 20 to 25 grams of protein
per meal. Every ounce of animal protein (which includes everything from
fish and poultry to pork and steak) contains about 8 grams of protein, while
vegetarian sources of protein like hard-boiled eggs and a half a cup of beans
have about 8 and 11 grams, respectively. Serving up a 3-ounce portion of
quality protein three times a day is one of the easiest ways to hit your
protein quota.
Exercise regularly. Physical activity may help reverse leptin resistance.
Improve your sleep quality. Poor sleep is implicated in problems with
leptin.
Ghrelin
Ghrelin is a hormone made in your gut. It travels through your bloodstream
to your brain, where it signals your brain to seek out food and eat. Thus, its
main function is to increase your appetite.
If you severely restrict your calories, the ghrelin levels will shoot up, and
you’re likely to feel ravenous—which is one reason why cutting calories
makes it so hard to stick to a diet.
How the Galveston Diet Helps Improve the Function of Ghrelin
The more ghrelin that’s secreted, the hungrier you are and the more you
want to eat, so it’s easy to see why you want to keep your ghrelin levels
under control! Here’s how the Galveston Diet does that:
Ease back on sugar intake. Avoid added sugars, especially high-
fructose corn syrup sweetened drinks.

Eat protein at every meal. This is especially the case when you
break a fast. For a woman over 50, a great goal is approximately
20 to 25 grams or around 3 ounces at each meal.
Eat high-fiber foods at meals. Fiber fills you up quickly and
increases satiety. It also prevents blood sugar levels from spiking
after a meal.
Cortisol
As if midlife weren’t hard enough just to get through, there’s also stress—
and plenty of it. We have stress at home, with our families, at work …
stress, stress, stress. When you’re under stress, your body releases stress
hormones, and one of these is cortisol.
When you’re faced with a stressor, cortisol stimulates the release of fat
and carbohydrates to give you the energy to fight or flee the situation. This
sudden energy surge can help you survive in a crisis or run away from
danger. The problem is that cortisol doesn’t know the difference between
true emergencies (avoiding a collision or running from an assailant) and
chronic “dangers” like financial worries, deadlines, family problems, and
other challenges of a fast-paced lifestyle.
When stress is chronic and unresolved, a constant stream of cortisol
floods your body. This may raise your blood sugar, alter your appetite,
stimulate your cravings, increase the rate at which you store fat, and
redistribute your fat to be stored viscerally. Chronically elevated cortisol
can also cause cells to become resistant to insulin.
How the Galveston Diet Regulates Cortisol
If you’ve ever been through a time in your life when you were constantly
stressed out, you probably felt less like yourself and more like a worn-out
shell of yourself. Cortisol—higher levels of it than usual—is the culprit.
That’s why it’s of utmost importance to figure out how to lower the cortisol.
And you can do it with certain foods you’ll find on the Galveston Diet:
Dark chocolate. After a hard day, some sweetness always seems to
satisfy—which is why I reach for a little dark chocolate. With 70 percent or
greater cocoa content, it has plenty of essential nutrients, for one thing.
Plus, it’s a stress reliever. Two studies of 95 adults showed that consuming
dark chocolate reduced their cortisol response to a stress challenge.

Include probiotics and prebiotics in your diet. Probiotics are friendly,
symbiotic bacteria in foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi. Various
studies have shown that increases in the probiotics in the gut can curb
inflammation and cortisol levels, and that this can help reduce symptoms of
depression, anxiety, and stress.
Found in soluble fiber, prebiotics are food for these bacteria in the gut
and have been found to help reduce cortisol levels.
Water your body. Staying well hydrated can keep physiological stress
levels down. When you do not supply your body with ample fluids, you’re
putting stress on it, and it will respond by increasing the cortisol levels.
How do you know if you are well hydrated? Look in the toilet. The color of
your urine should be very light yellow to clear. Anything darker can
indicate dehydration.
Focus on fish oil. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to
reduce cortisol. Don’t confuse omega-3 fats with omega-6 fats! Omega-6
fatty acids—found in processed snacks, fast foods, cakes, fatty meats, and
cured meats—tend to promote inflammation.
Lifestyle modifications also help regulate cortisol. As you’re
transitioning through the hormonal changes of midlife, these strategies are
even more important:
Manage stress. There are lots of ways to relieve stress, from engaging in
relaxation programs to those devoted to stress management, to yoga. One of
the best strategies I’ve found is meditation. It has been shown to
significantly reduce cortisol levels. Consider a trial subscription to the Calm
or Headspace apps to give you a beginner’s framework for meditation.
Also, the simple act of listening to music you enjoy can reduce levels of
stress-induced cortisol.
Strive for quality sleep. In several studies, people getting less sleep or
poor quality sleep had significantly higher cortisol levels compared to
control groups.
Work it out. Numerous studies have shown that moderate exercise
decreases cortisol levels.
Neuropeptide Y
Many people talk about the addictive power of carbohydrates. I certainly
agree—and the ease with which you can get hooked on them is something
I’ve heard from many of my patients, too. But like weight gain, these

addictive-like cravings are not your fault. Blame them on neuropeptide Y
(NPY)! That’s the hormone that drives carbohydrate cravings.
Another crazy aspect of NPY is that it is also highly involved in the
motivation and search for food. Those times when you’ve rummaged
through the fridge looking for food? That’s NPY at work.
Produced by cells in the brain and nervous system, neuropeptide Y is one
of the most powerful stimulators of appetite. It is triggered by low leptin
levels and caloric restriction (which partly explains why so many diets fail);
its levels are highest when we are fasting and lowest after a meal.
Additionally, levels of NPY are elevated during times of stress, which can
lead to overeating and visceral fat gain.
NPY tends to lead us to decrease the time between meals, makes us feel
more motivated to eat, and delays the brain’s signal that we are full.
How the Galveston Diet Lowers NPY
When you start refocusing your fuel on the Galveston Diet, you can expect
your carb cravings to become a thing of the past. Here’s how to make this a
habit:
Eat the right amount of protein. People on low-protein diets can often
have elevated NPY levels. Adequate protein for a woman over 50 is 20 to
25 grams, or about 3 ounces of high-quality protein, three times a day.
Include enough prebiotic soluble fiber in your diet. Soluble fiber feeds
the friendly bacteria in the digestive system to ensure a healthy gut and
fights cravings for carbs when you don’t need them.
Manage stress. Similar to cortisol, NPY can be lowered by adopting
behaviors that decrease stress in your life.
Glucagon-Like Peptide-1
A hormone made by your gut when nutrients enter the intestines is
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Higher levels of GLP-1 curb your appetite
and are linked to weight loss. This hormone also slows down the digestion
process and helps nutrients be released more evenly. It improves insulin
production in the body and prevents your liver from releasing more sugar
into your blood than needed. GLP-1 is thus very important to blood sugar
and insulin control.
How the Galveston Diet Increases GLP-1

When you start following the Galveston Diet, you’ll find yourself
increasingly less hungry, with fewer cravings. One big reason is that you’ll
be eating more foods that boost GLP-1. My recommendations are as
follows:
Fish, whey protein (cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, and milk), and
yogurt. These foods have been shown to increase GLP-1 levels and
improve insulin sensitivity. (Whey is the watery milk that has separated
from the curds when cheese is made.)
Foods rich in antioxidants (mainly vegetables and fruits). These foods
prevent chronic inflammation, which is linked to lower GLP-1 levels, so a
diet with these nutrients can increase GLP-1 levels. Also, leafy greens like
spinach and kale have been shown in research to stimulate higher GLP-1
levels and support weight loss.
Probiotic foods, such as yogurt. Probiotics have been shown to increase
GLP-1 levels and decrease food intake.
Cholecystokinin
Here is another very interesting hormone—cholecystokinin (CCK). It is
beneficial to anyone who wants to lose weight—for two main reasons.
First, it works like an appetite suppressant, curbing your food intake.
This is definitely an advantage if you’re trying to eat less and shed body fat.
This is the case because the CCK slows down the rate at which food moves
through your digestive tract, giving you the sensation of feeling full longer.
Second, CCK stimulates the breakdown of fat tissue so it can be burned.
This helps improve your body composition, as well as appetite control.
In the body, CCK is manufactured by specialized cells in the intestinal
lining when you eat a meal that contains fat. Basically, it triggers the release
of bile and pancreatic enzymes for fat digestion.
How the Galveston Diet Increases CCK
You’ll be eating the following foods for lots of other reasons, too (see
previous reasons!), but they also enhance CCK production: Eat foods rich
in protein, fat, and fiber. Also, eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, such
as fish.
Pancreatic Peptide YY

The pancreatic peptide YY (PYY) is a hormone produced in the small
intestine. It is released after eating and it suppresses your appetite. In fact, it
is one of the hormones that makes you feel full after eating because it slows
the emptying of your stomach.
The amount of PYY dispatched into the blood depends on the type of
food you eat. Fats and protein, for example, stimulate the greatest release of
this hormone. Its secretion can also be stimulated by digestive juices (such
as bile).
Levels of PYY are highest in the second hour after eating, after which
they gradually decrease. Low levels of PPY are seen during long periods
without eating, such as overnight.
With low PYY concentrations, you’ll feel an increase in your appetite,
and you’ll want to keep eating. People who are obese or who have type 2
diabetes tend to have low levels—which obviously then aggravates weight
gain.
How the Galveston Diet Increases PYY
The meal plans you follow on the Galveston Diet are geared to help you
regulate PYY, along with other hormones. As you’ll see, the ideal scenario
is as follows:
Eat a lower-carb diet. This is done in an effort to stabilize blood glucose
levels. Elevated blood sugar may hinder PYY’s effects.
Eat sufficient amounts of protein. The protein can come from either
animal or plant sources; my meal plans will show you how.
Include adequate fiber. Getting enough fiber is essential in your diet.
Understanding how hormones impact your weight and other symptoms is
an important first step toward good health. When you realize that your
behavior concerning food is hormonally driven, you can stop beating
yourself up for supposed failures and concentrate on changing the pattern of
your eating. You have far more control over your body than you realize!
You have nothing to lose—except those stubborn pounds!
Hot Flash: Should You Consider Hormone Replacement
Therapy?

Great progress has been made in the field of hormone replacement
therapy (HRT), and it’s here to stay. HRT can be life-changing for
many women.
HRT has so many benefits. It can:
Whittle your waistline by reducing abdominal fat
Redistribute your body fat so that you’re a little more
proportional
Lower fasting glucose and insulin levels, helping to prevent
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes
Improve blood lipid profiles, including cholesterol and
triglycerides, often the scourge of a healthy heart, and
therefore cut your risk of cardiovascular disease
Reduce bone loss, thereby helping to prevent osteoporosis
Improve cognition (less brain fog!)
Enhance your sense of well-being
No one can decide if HRT is right for you except you and your
doctor, but the more science-based information you have, the more
informed your choice will be and the more confident you’ll feel
about your decision. Here are some of the key factors I discuss
with women who are considering HRT:
Generally, you should start treatment during perimenopause
or in the first few years after menopause.
Realize that it is mainly the deficiency of estrogen in your
system that causes some of your weight gain and other
noticeable symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. For
this reason, HRT has been approved only to treat vasomotor
disturbances (changes in the function of the vascular system
such hot flashes) and to reverse vaginal changes, such as the
thinning of the vaginal wall and lack of lubrication. The FDA
has not approved HRT for losing visceral fat or reducing
inflammation (although HRT can help with both).
If you have a uterus, understand that you must not take
estrogen alone, due to the risk of endometrial cancer. The
addition of progesterone to the therapy decreases this risk, and

combination therapy is always the therapy of choice. If you do
not have a uterus, progesterone is not necessary.
Please consult a physician who is knowledgeable about HRT and
can individualize it to your particular situation. See Resources on
page 261 for a link to a list of “menopause friendly” health care
providers on my website.




CHAPTER 3
Prepare to Change Your Life
You know that losing weight and resolving midlife symptoms while you’re
on the Galveston Diet will make you healthier. The very good news is that
once you’re well into the program, you can substantially reduce belly fat,
hot flashes, fatigue, brain fog, bad moods, and more. I’ve seen women just
two weeks into the program begin to experience these positive changes. So
every effort you make is going to be rewarded!
That said, I know you’re eager to begin your new lifestyle. But before
you actually jump in, I want to caution you to ease into the plan. Take at
least a few days or a week to read through this book. It’s important that you
know exactly what is going on in your body at this stage of your life, that
you understand why the program contains what it does, and that you see
how the three components work together. You need to understand what the
meal plans entail and why they are constructed as they are.
Let this information really sink in. When you arm yourself with
nutritional knowledge, you will be more successful with the lifestyle
changes and will make greater progress toward reducing disease risk and
becoming healthier.
So, again, my first piece of advice is to not rush. Take time to invest in
yourself. You have the rest of your life to master the plan! That said, here
are several preparatory steps that will help you be successful.
Know Your Measurements
You won’t know how very successful you’ve been unless you have a clear
vision of where you started—where you are now. So, it’s important to take
certain bodily measurements and occasionally use your scale to gauge your
results.
1. Check your beginning weight. I teach my students on the Galveston
Diet to “break up” with their scale. I know this feels scary, so let’s talk

about it. The scale is helpful, but it’s not the only measure there is, because
it doesn’t really assess how healthy you are. Remember, the main goal of
this program is to get you as healthy as possible. It is common for women
on this program to lose inches, especially around the waist, without any
weight loss registering on the scale. This occurs because they are most
likely gaining lean muscle while losing body fat, and muscle generally
weighs more than fat. Plus, muscle takes up less space on the body. It’s
okay to consider the number on the scale in your overall assessment, but do
not allow it to be the final word.
So, weigh yourself today, write down that weight in a little notebook
along with the date, and keep that notebook handy. Just remember that your
weight is only one data point to gauge your progress; don’t get obsessed
with what the scale says.
2. Take your body’s circumference measurements. Buy a cloth tape
measure and measure your hip, abdominal, and inner thigh circumferences.
Write the measurements down in your notebook where you’ve recorded
your weight measurement.
Here are some tips for measuring:
For accuracy, take your measurements in the nude first thing in the
morning, prior to breaking your fast, so as to avoid any post-meal
bloating.
Breathe normally and don’t “suck in” to get a better number. You want
your measurements to reflect your true stats.
Measure yourself in front of a mirror to ensure that your tape measure
is held straight.
For your waist circumference, stand up straight and exhale. Measure
around the smallest part of your waist; for many women, this is just
above your navel, but yours might be higher.
Note: Your waist measurement is one of the most important assessments
of your overall health. Too much fat around the waist indicates that you
might be carrying excess visceral fat. Visceral fat presents significant health
risks. Ideally, you should have a waist circumference of below 35 inches.
For your hip circumference, measure the distance around the widest
part of your buttocks. Although everyone varies, the hip measurement

is about 7 inches below the waist.
Pull the tape so that it is snug but not too tight.
3. Calculate your waist-to-hip ratio. Your waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is
the gauge of your body weight distribution, particularly in terms of health.
In fact, it is the most important assessment you’ll take on the Galveston
Diet because it indicates how healthy you are, as well as pointing to any
health risks you may be facing. As your WHR improves, your health will
improve—which is the number one goal of this program.
Now, to calculate your WHR, divide your waist circumference by your
hip circumference. Record the WHR and add it to your little notebook.
4. Take a photo of yourself. It may feel uncomfortable or daunting to
do, but trust me, later on you will love being able to see your results as you
progress through the program.
Following the plan, you will again measure yourself after four weeks and
will recalculate your WHR. Expect to be totally inspired by the inches and
pounds you’ve trimmed off your body—a sign that you’re burning pure fat
and improving your overall health.
Your WHR and Your Health
A very large body of scientific evidence shows that a high WHR
can forecast cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes,
gallbladder disease, even cancer.
Menopausal women often see a significant increase in their
WHR—which implies that they are at significant risk for heart
disease, hip fracture, and certain cancers (including breast cancer
and endometrial cancer). On a positive note, researchers have also
found that decreasing your WHR is associated with greater health
benefits and lowered risk of developing these diseases.
As a general guide, here’s a commonly used chart to give you an
idea of what your current waist-to-hip ratio might foreshadow.
Waist-to-Hip Ratio

Health Risk Women
Low 0.80 or lower
Moderate 0.81–0.85
High 0.86 or higher
Get a Nutrition Tracker
Since founding the organization and creating the Galveston Diet in 2017,
I’ve observed that the women who are the most successful with the program
monitor their micronutrients and macronutrients (the “macros”).
Macronutrients are the three categories of nutrients you eat the most and
that provide you with most of your fuel: carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
Micronutrients, on the other hand, are vital nutrients your body uses in
smaller amounts: vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and
phytochemicals. You can track both of these via a phone app.
My favorite nutrition tracking app is Cronometer. This app has a
comprehensive and extensive nutritional database that helps you develop
the habit of refocusing your fuel. Other good tracker apps are Carb
Manager, MyFitnessPal, Fitbit, Lose It!, and MyNetDiary. You’ll need a
smartphone, of course. After downloading the app of choice, you use the
database to start gaining control of your nutrition choices and become more
mindful of your intake. Using these apps is akin to using cash or a debit
card rather than a credit card to pay for something; you always know
exactly where you are in your nutritional “budget.”
It’s a good idea to make sure the app you choose can track customized
macro percentages and net carbs (total carbs minus fiber; see page 106 for
more on why this is important). As an experiment, use your chosen app to
start keeping track of what you eat this initial week.
Of course, you won’t be tracking or counting calories on the Galveston
Diet. As mentioned earlier, counting calories isn’t the best approach to
weight loss—and here’s why. Calories are not created equal; different foods
have vastly different effects on your hormones, energy expenditures, and
feelings of hunger. When you eat low-quality, processed foods that are high
in empty calories, your body never feels satisfied. It continues to ask you
for more food, in the hope you’ll keep feeding it and supply more nutrients.
Translation: you overeat and you gain weight.

The opposite happens when you enjoy high-quality, nutritious foods.
You’re less likely to overeat because you’re nourishing your body with
what it needs, in the appropriate amounts. For most people, simply
changing their food selections to those on this plan will support weight loss,
burn fat, discourage cravings, and build health.
Start a Daily Journaling Practice
I’m a strong believer in daily journaling. The practice of sitting down and
recording your thoughts each day helps you focus on setting and achieving
your goals (mental, physical, dietary, activity, and so forth). Such
contemplation also leads to practicing gratitude for help or encouragement
you’ve received from others. Journaling is essentially a way to hold
yourself accountable. Your journal is also a great place to document your
body measurements and WHR. You can also use the first couple pages of
your journal to record your personal health and weight goals.
The amount of journaling you choose to do is individual, and by all
means feel free to write about whatever is on your mind. But in terms of the
program, here are some topics to consider each day:
Today I am grateful for:__________________________________
Two self-care practices I will do just for me:___________________
Today’s victories or celebrations:____________________________
My daily intentions:_____________________________________
(Note: These are personal commitments, such as “I will try something
challenging today,” “I accept myself as enough,” “I believe I am
beautiful,” “I will develop a healthy relationship with my body,” “I
will commit to my meal plan,” and so forth.)
Today, I am letting go of:_________________________________
(For example, grudges, certain negative thoughts, regrets, self-imposed
stress, and so forth.)
My exercise plan today:__________________________________
My fasting window:_______ (Such as 8 p.m. to noon the next day.)
My daily macros: carbs ________ fats ________ protein ________
You don’t need any fancy book to journal—just a notebook if writing by
hand, or a dedicated file on your laptop or iPad. For further ideas, see the

Daily Recharge Journal that I also created, available on my website. It has
spaces for each of these topics every day.
Consider Certain Supplements
A lot of people ask me about the value of taking nutritional supplements.
My response is always to emphasize, above all, that supplements are just
that—they are meant to supplement your diet, not to replace foods. Your
nutrition should come primarily from whole, natural foods, not from pills.
Fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods contain nutrients and other
substances not found in pills or capsules. You just can’t get that synergistic
benefit from a supplement.
That said, the average American diet leaves a lot to be desired. Studies
show that our meals are lacking in a number of important nutrients,
including magnesium, vitamin D, and fiber. True, many of these nutrients
are difficult to obtain through diet alone, and I’ve struggled with this issue
myself.
I have designed the Galveston Diet to be high in fiber, vitamin D,
magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, and other essential nutrients. In Chapter 7,
you’ll learn how to select the food sources with the most nutrition. Still, you
may not obtain all you need. In that case, supplements can be a buffer,
making up for what might be lacking. Although you do not need
supplements to be successful on the Galveston Diet, consider taking the
following three supplements—just to cover your bases.
Fiber Supplements
It can be difficult to obtain all the fiber you need for good health from food
alone. Trust me, I’ve tried! All of us need between 25 and 30 grams of fiber
daily. That is a lot, so supplementation is a great option. Another reason I
recommend fiber supplementation is personal. I had an uncle who died of
colon cancer at age 51. He was diagnosed with the disease in his forties,
and he fought it for many years before succumbing. I also have aunts,
uncles, cousins, and two brothers who died of cancer. I believe something
genetic is going on and that I may have a predisposition for it—which is
why I want to be in the best possible position to fight cancer, should I be
diagnosed with it.
Fiber may be protective against cancer. A large body of literature
suggests that eating a variety of foods containing high fiber has a protective

effect against colon cancer, for example. Evidence also indicates that a high
fiber diet may be protective against breast, ovary, endometrial, and
gastrointestinal cancer.
There are many fiber supplements available, and I offer one on my
website (see Resources on page 261 or access the link there for more
information). If you’re considering taking a fiber supplement, here’s what
to look for when choosing a product:
Check that it contains both soluble and insoluble fiber.
Be aware of the fiber source. Some fibers are derived from natural
ingredients while others are synthetic. It is better for your health and
digestion to supplement with natural fibers. When formulating our
company’s fiber supplement, I chose natural gluten-free fibers such as
buckwheat (both soluble and insoluble), chia seeds (soluble), millet
(insoluble), amaranth (insoluble), and quinoa (both soluble and
insoluble). Other good natural fiber sources are pectin, a soluble fiber
found in fruits and berries, and psyllium, a soluble fiber from the husk
of the Plantago genus of plants.
Read the labels for sugar content. Many flavored fiber supplements—
including powders and gummies—can contain an appalling amount of
sugar. One very popular brand of psyllium husk fiber contains 16
grams of sugar per dose—that’s equivalent to 4 teaspoons! You can
avoid all that extra sugar by opting for sugar-free versions of powders
(make sure they’re sweetened with monk fruit or stevia, not chemical
sweeteners).
A word of caution: If you’re not accustomed to taking fiber supplements,
start slowly. Adding a lot of fiber to your diet right away can trigger some
uncomfortable side effects, like bloating, cramping, and gas. Gradually
build up how much you take, perhaps starting with half the recommended
dose for one to two weeks, before taking the full daily dose. It also helps to
take fiber supplements with a large glass of water and to stay hydrated
throughout the day.
Vitamin D
The body requires sunlight to manufacture vitamin D, but as a nation, we
are deficient in this vitamin. One reason for this is that we’re eating fewer

dairy products, which are good sources of vitamin D. Also, more and more
people are sitting inside (in offices or in front of home screens) every day
and not getting outside much. If you live at a latitude where sunlight is
limited for part of the year, you likely won’t get the vitamin D you need
during that time. Or, if you live where there are long days of daily sunshine,
you may be using lots of sunscreen and staying out of the sun to avoid skin
cancer. And, finally, if you have darker pigmented skin, you don’t absorb as
much sunlight, which means you have less sunlight to convert vitamin D to
its active form.
The recommended form of vitamin D is vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol,
because the body absorbs it more easily.
Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplements
I have an ongoing love affair with omega-3 fatty acids because they offer so
many powerful benefits for your body and brain; I discuss these at length in
Chapter 7.
Although omega-3 fatty acids are found in foods—fish, seeds, and nuts,
most prominently—it can be difficult to obtain all their health benefits from
food alone. This is why I recommend supplementation.
When choosing a supplement, make sure it contains eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These are the most effective
omega-3 fats, and they are found in fatty fish and algae.
There are no official guidelines for the intake of omega-3s, but respected
health organizations generally recommend a 500 mg minimum of combined
EPA and DHA per day, unless instructed otherwise by a health professional.
Hot Flash: Three Things to Do—Starting Now!
If you are in perimenopause or menopause, please pay attention.
As you begin the Galveston Diet (Part II), you must do three things
now for your health:
Make sure you’re doing the right type and duration of
exercise for your body. This is usually a combination of
resistance training and cardio. If you’re not currently
exercising, join a workout facility, get a trainer, or set up a
home workout plan for yourself. Get moving at least three

times a week for 45 minutes to 1 hour each session. Studies
have shown that many of the changes—both physical and
mental—that we associate with aging and menopause are at
least partially the result of inactivity.
Get mentally prepared to change your nutrition. In terms of
perimenopause and menopause, be aware of which foods are
high in protein, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, and fiber;
for example: veggies, fruits, fish, poultry. Add these foods to
your diet, if you don’t already eat them on a daily basis. Cut
down on empty calories from sugar, junk food, and alcohol.
Drink enough water daily, too (around 64 fluid ounces/2
quarts each day). Water carries nutrients, hormones, and
oxygen to your cells and disposes of waste products through
your bloodstream and lymphatic system (a network of delicate
tubes throughout the body). Water also lubricates your joints,
enhances your health, and makes you more energetic,
physically and mentally.
Quit smoking. There are countless health reasons why you
should stop smoking. But there are even more reasons when it
comes perimenopause and menopause. For one thing, female
smokers have more hot flashes as they transition through
menopause, and smoking can initiate early menopause owing
to its impact on reducing estrogen production. The main
reason for this has to do with nicotine (from smoking and
vaping); nicotine slashes the circulating estrogen levels and
leads to early menopause.
What’s more, smoking during perimenopause and
menopause increases the risk dramatically for diseases such as
cancer, heart disease, stroke, and osteoporosis. If you’re
considering hormone replacement therapy, most doctors will
not even prescribe it if you smoke because of smoking’s
adverse effect on hormones. So, join a smoking-cessation
program or ask your physician for recommendations on how
to quit.

It makes sense that when your body is in a time of remarkable
change you would want to give it all the additional help you can.
These three actions are a great place to start.
Set Up Your World for Success
Your environment—physical and social—can have a big impact on your
long-term success and play a huge role in driving positive behaviors.
Environment influences your decisions, your choices, and your attitude.
Your social environment is critical for success. For example, it is
important to let your family, friends, and coworkers know what you are
about to do. I don’t think I could have succeeded, not only in doing my
early version of diet but also in developing it, had it not been for the
complete support of my family.
Studies show that we reflect the behaviors of the people around us. That
means it’s crucial that your social circle is supportive and inspiring. Most
important, it should NOT be destructive or negative, or have a tendency to
sabotage your efforts. Would you consider doing the Galveston Diet with a
friend? Could you find a workout buddy? However you can, surround
yourself with people who are also working on improving their health,
fitness, and nutrition. A lot of women who have made the Galveston Diet
their new lifestyle tell me that they benefited from the support they found
on my online community. Get online and join them! See Resources on page
261.
Your physical environment is equally important. Here are some easy
suggestions for setting it up to support your success:
Stock your kitchen with all the essential foods and ingredients used in
The Galveston Diet.
Remove the foods that tempt you and replace them with ones that
support your goals. Or, buy the tempting foods only for special
occasions and preferably in small quantities.
Get into the habit of meal prepping, using the meal plans in Chapter 8
as a guide. Prepare meals and snacks ahead of time, for example. Have
fresh, healthy whole foods on hand and prepped. If necessary, buy pre-
cut veggies. I include some specific meal prep tips in Chapter 8.

Establishing a positive environment is an important way for you to make
progress in the program. In doing so, you will control your environment
before it controls you. This makes problem behaviors inconvenient and
healthy behaviors convenient.
Losing weight, keeping it off, and getting healthier are not quick fixes.
Nor will a quick fix keep the weight off. These quick fixes and fad diets can
sometimes make the situation worse, and possibly harm your health.
Optimally, the only weight you can keep off long term is weight that has
been lost slowly, following a healthy diet geared to meet your needs at these
midlife stages of hormonal fluctuation. So, focus on eating healthy foods
and engaging in fit-friendly activities you enjoy. Yes, you can still love
pizza every now and then, and have a glass of wine. Modifying your eating
habits isn’t meant to be restrictive; actually, it’s freedom. You make healthy
changes you can live with for a happier long term.








CHAPTER 4
Action 1:
Intermittent Fasting
I didn’t want to adopt the practice of intermittent fasting (IF) when I first
heard about it. I was skeptical. I thought it was a fad. I didn’t want to give
up my morning coffee the way I like to drink it, and I wasn’t ready to ditch
breakfast.
But because I was at work developing the Galveston Diet, I kept an open
mind and dug into the research. I watched a TED Talk by Dr. Mark
Mattson, who was chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National
Institute on Aging, and who has done extensive research on intermittent
fasting. He has stated that intermittent fasting powerfully combats
inflammation. That point alone sold me on IF. I already knew that the
Galveston Diet would incorporate anti-inflammatory foods, so adding
intermittent fasting to the plan made perfect sense: it was one more weapon
to fight inflammation.
From experience, I know that intermittent fasting is a game changer.
Let’s unpack how it’s done and why it will help you stay leaner, healthier,
and younger for longer.
What Is Intermittent Fasting?
Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of
eating and of not eating (fasting). There are a number of ways to go about
it. One way is the 5:2 method, in which you fast for one full day, twice a
week. After your fast days, you can enjoy regular meals on the remaining 5
days.
Another method is Eat Stop Eat, meaning that you do a 24-hour fast once
or twice a week. For example, you fast from dinner one day to dinner the
next day. This constitutes a full 24-hour fast. Similarly, One Meal a Day

(OMAD) means that you fast most of the day, then eat one large meal. It
could be breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You follow this pattern of eating every
day.
Another variation is alternate-day fasting. This is a full 24 hours without
eating anything or only eating a small amount, followed by 24 hours of
eating as usual (say, three regular meals). You simply alternate the pattern:
one day of fasting, followed by one day of regular meals.
Early time-restricted feeding (eTRF) is another method. It restricts your
mealtimes to the morning and early afternoon, followed by a fast that lasts
the rest of the day and evening.
The 16:8 Intermittent Fast
For the Galveston Diet, I recommend the 16:8 method of intermittent
fasting. This fasting/eating pattern involves taking in all your meals within
an 8-hour daily window of time. You then fast, or go without food, for the
following 16 hours, and much of this occurs overnight, while you’re
sleeping. You can repeat this cycle as frequently as you’d like, from just
once or twice a week to every day, but for the greatest benefit, follow the
16:8 pattern every day of the week.
The 16:8 pattern of intermittent fasting is simple to follow; I call it
“fasting made easy.” It provides measurable results with minimal disruption
to your diet, and is generally considered less restrictive than the other
methods. Additionally, it works with just about any lifestyle. Most of the
participants on the Galveston Diet online program found that 16:8 is the
easiest fasting plan to stick to, because it is closest to a normal eating
schedule. It also builds a daily sustainable habit, which is critical to success
in the program.
The most common way to do 16:8 is to skip your normal early morning
breakfast, have your first meal around noon, and finish your dinner by 8
p.m. In this way, if you end your last meal at 8 p.m. and don’t eat until noon
the next day, you’ve fasted for a full 16 hours.
But what if you usually finish your dinnertime much earlier than 8 p.m.?
Don’t worry: 16:8 is very flexible. As long as you maintain your eating and
fasting windows, you can set it up to work for you.
Within your feeding window, on the program you eat two healthy
Galveston Diet–friendly meals and two snacks, without counting calories.
The 16:8 method won’t work effectively, however, if you eat lots of

processed foods, including those with added sugar, junk food, or refined
carbs. You can drink water, black coffee, and plain tea during the fast,
because fluid intake is critical when fasting.
The evidence for the health benefits of 16:8 daily fasting has been
growing over the past few years. A study in the journal Cell Metabolism
reported that this method “resulted in weight loss, reduced abdominal fat,
lower blood pressure, and healthier cholesterol readings.” Incidentally, it is
also one of the best treatments for brain fog. (For details on the benefits of
intermittent fasting, see pages 70–75.)
The Earliest Fasts
Fasting, in general, is nothing new. Many religions practice fasting as part
of their rituals. Muslims fast from dawn to dusk during the month of
Ramadan, and Jews, Buddhists, and Hindus traditionally fast on designated
days of the week or at times throughout the calendar year. Within
Christianity, fasting practices vary. The Bible does not require a specific
day or time for fasting, but it does refer to fasting as a beneficial spiritual
practice. Catholics fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, for example,
and Mormons fast on the first Sunday of each month. Religions have long
emphasized that fasting is good for the soul and expresses devotion, but its
health benefits were not recognized until the early 1900s, when doctors
used it to treat various disorders, including diabetes, obesity, and epilepsy.
Fasting predates organized religion, though. Our hunter-gatherer
ancestors were the original intermittent fasters. After successfully hunting
for meat or foraging for plants, they feasted. When the hunt failed or there
were no plants to gather, they fasted. As a result, they evolved to be able to
fully function without food for extended periods of time. All this means that
from an ancestral perspective, our bodies are genetically geared to thrive on
a fast-and-feast cycle. In other words, we’re wired for intermittent fasting.
The Benefits of Intermittent Fasting
When done safely, intermittent fasting offers enormous health benefits to
your cells, organs, bloodstream, hormones, bodily systems, and other parts
and functions of your body. Let’s look at the benefits of all types of
intermittent fasting.
Blood Sugar and Insulin Control

Intermittent fasting also improves insulin sensitivity and reduces insulin
levels. Lower insulin levels help the body burn fat more readily. Because it
improves insulin sensitivity, intermittent fasting can help reduce insulin
resistance. In addition, IF has been found to lower blood sugar by 3 to 6
percent and fasting insulin levels by 20 to 31 percent—reductions that can
help protect against type 2 diabetes. Such findings are important because
disordered blood sugar and insulin are big drivers of inflammation.
A large study in 2018 found that nearly half the participants with type 2
diabetes were able to stop using their diabetes medication and achieve
remission after adopting the habit of intermittent fasting for 12 months.
That’s a quite remarkable outcome when it comes to managing and
controlling type 2 diabetes. (Of course, never stop or reduce any medication
without first consulting your physician.)
Cellular Renewal
Researchers believe that when you practice intermittent fasting, your cells
undergo a small amount of stress, which seems to continually recharge the
cellular defenses against molecular damage and builds your resistance to
disease. Although the word stress sounds like a negative, taxing the body is
beneficial in much the same way as exercising stresses your muscles and
heart. As long as you allow your body time to recover, it will grow stronger.
There is a lot of similarity between how your body responds to the stress of
physical activity and how cells respond to intermittent fasting.
One of these responses is autophagy, a rejuvenation process that goes on
at the cellular level. Think of autophagy as a kind of garbage disposal
system in which cells eliminate damaged molecules, including those that
have been associated with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurological
diseases.
Autophagy may help many aspects of the human body, including:
Disease prevention and reversal of age-related illnesses
Extended longevity and anti-aging
Immune system support
Intermittent fasting also ramps up levels of “chaperone proteins” in the
cells. For perspective on this, think of proteins as the workhorses of the
cells, each with its own specific task.

The primary structure for proteins inside the cells is a chain of amino
acids. These proteins are only useful to the cells when their chains fold into
a particular shape. Improperly folded proteins can’t do their jobs; they stick
together, develop clumps, and congest the cell.
Many proteins cannot fold themselves unless they get help from the
chaperone proteins. Without these chaperones, the proteins can’t take on
their correct form and the cell’s health can be compromised. But when
proteins are properly folded, it’s the chaperones that are calling the shots.
Chaperone proteins are also natural, free-radical scavengers inside the
cells. They find disease-causing free radicals and eliminate them, thus
combating cell degeneration.
Anti-Inflammation
Chronic inflammation, which underlies many diseases such as diabetes,
joint problems, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel syndrome
(IBS), can be reduced with intermittent fasting. One of the reasons for this
has to do with the monocyte, a type of white blood cell that helps fight
bacteria, viruses, and other infections in the body. In a 2019 report in the
journal Cell, scientists reported that monocytes in the blood were less
inflammatory when people and mice fasted intermittently.
Galectin-3, another substance found in the blood, is also linked to chronic
inflammation. Scientists from the Intermountain Healthcare Heart Institute
found that intermittent fasting can increase the levels of this protein,
thereby reducing inflammation in the body.
We also know from other studies that intermittent fasting helps ease
inflammatory illnesses. Many joint issues, including rheumatoid arthritis,
are tied to inflammation. Drops in inflammation have been seen in patients
who practice intermittent fasting, and reduced inflammation can relieve
pain and help protect joints.
One of the earliest pieces of evidence showing the link between fasting
and inflammation involved overweight adults with moderate asthma. They
went on an alternate-day fasting program and lost 8 percent of their weight
over 8 weeks. Plus, they saw a reduction in markers of inflammation and
improvements in their asthma symptoms.
The anti-inflammatory benefits of IF have been found to help keep
arteries clear of buildup. A 2009 study reported in the American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition discovered that intermittent fasting (alternate-day fasting)

reduced total cholesterol, the “bad” LDL cholesterol, and blood
triglycerides—all risk factors for heart disease and narrowed arteries.
Brain Health
Various studies, including a 2020 report in Brain and Behavior, show that
IF can stimulate the growth of new brain cells and signaling pathways in the
brain, a process called neuroplasticity, especially in the hippocampus (the
center for learning and memory).
The fact that intermittent fasting triggers the formation and release of
ketones is important, too, since their release into the bloodstream has been
shown to protect memory and learning, as well as slow the process of
disease in the brain.
The autophagy that comes with IF clears out dying or damaged cells and
toxic proteins from the brain, helping to prevent dementia.
Finally, animal studies show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) also increases with intermittent fasting. BDNF is important for
cognitive function and mood.
Protection Against Cancer
Among women, the five most common cancers are breast, colorectal, lung,
cervix, and stomach cancers. Of these, breast cancer is considered the
second most common cancer in the world.
A review published in the Journal of Mid-Life Health covered reasons
why intermittent fasting might offer protection against many of these
cancers, primarily because it interferes with mechanisms that promote
cancer and its spread. Fasting, for example, reduces inflammation, which is
associated with the development and progression of cancer. Fasting also
inhibits tumor growth by interfering with angiogenesis, which is the
creation of new blood vessels that feed tumors. Tumors can’t grow without
having a blood supply; thus, fasting can potentially slow tumor growth.
Fasting also fights obesity, which is a risk factor for cancer.
In addition, intermittent fasting reduces levels of a hormone called
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Essential for normal growth and
cellular activity, and produced in the liver, this hormone is naturally very
important when we’re young. But elevated IGF-1 seems to be associated
with aging and the development of cancer as we get older. Having high
levels of IGF-1 in the body is like driving a car hard and fast, with no repair

or maintenance, which likely produces defects in the car’s engine. In the
body, IGF-1 produces defects in the cells. The result is a higher risk of
cancer and age-related diseases. However, human and animal studies have
consistently shown reductions in IGF-1 levels when organisms fast. It is
thought that fasting makes our bodies turn off growth and concentrate more
on repair and maintenance activities—and quite possibly cut the risk of
certain cancers.
Gene Expression and Anti-Aging
A gene is a tiny piece of hereditary material written in code and contained
within a long molecule called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The genes are
responsible for a lot that goes on in your body, from metabolism to
immunity to longevity. When genes are “expressed,” this means they are
used as blueprints for making proteins that tell a cell what to do. Gene
expression is thus the process by which the information contained within a
gene becomes a useful product—such as a protein—that performs a specific
function.
Gene expression can be stimulated (upregulated) or suppressed
(downregulated) based on a number of factors. One of these factors is
intermittent fasting. A 2020 study suggested that just 30 days of moderate
intermittent fasting (similar to the 16:8 pattern) can lead to measurable
changes in the genes that may promote human health and longevity.
Intermittent fasting has also been found to slow the degradation of DNA,
which is what occurs when we age, and to accelerate DNA repair, thus
slowing down the aging process.
Fasting also increases the levels of antioxidants that can help prevent the
body’s cells from being harmed by free radicals, which are molecules that
inflict cellular damage.
Weight Control
Studies show that people who do intermittent fasting lose weight and have a
lower body mass index. They are also able to maintain their weight loss.
A 2014 review study published in Translational Research found that this
eating pattern can promote a 3 to 8 percent reduction in weight over 3 to 24
weeks, which is a significant amount compared to most weight-loss studies.
The dieters also shed 4 to 7 percent of their waist circumference. This is a

substantial loss of visceral fat—the dangerous kind that accumulates around
your organs and can lead to disease.
All this occurs because after fasting for 12 hours or longer, you start
burning stored fat for energy instead of glucose. Fatty acids are converted to
ketone bodies in the liver, which are then released into the bloodstream and
used by the body and brain for energy.
Importantly, intermittent fasting spares lean muscle. This is a huge plus
for women in midlife, because a primary symptom associated with
menopause—and aging in general—is the loss of muscle. This loss
contributes to lower strength, a slower metabolism, and accelerated aging.
Intermittent fasting also alters the hormone levels to make stored body fat
more accessible to burn. For example, the levels of growth hormone (GH)
skyrocket when you fast intermittently, increasing as much as fivefold. The
GH helps the body burn fat and create lean muscle.
The Joy of Change
Intermittent fasting was a game-changer for Kelly. At age 42, she
started experiencing almost every symptom imaginable in
perimenopause. She wasn’t technically overweight, but she was
tired, depressed, bloated, constantly hungry, and generally unhappy
with her body—even though she was active and worked out.
Kelly was intrigued by intermittent fasting and what she had
learned about it. She started practicing it by easing into the habit.
After a few weeks, she was consistently fasting for 16 to 18 hours
a day.
Kelly reported the following: “I feel so much better. I have this
energy that had been missing for a long time. I’m not hungry all
the time anymore. My clothes fit better, and the bloat is gone. I feel
so light and confident now.”
How to Start Intermittent Fasting—and Be Successful
The first step is to learn how to do intermittent fasting properly. If you jump
in too quickly, or go about it in the wrong way, you may not get the results
you want. Here’s how to be successful.

Begin Gradually
If you’ve never done IF, start gradually. When I began intermittent fasting, I
began by pushing my eating window by 30 minutes. That is, I used to eat
breakfast at 6:30 a.m., so I began at 7 a.m. and did that until it felt natural. I
repeated that process every few days in 30-minute increments until I
reached my goal of eating at noon. It took about a month, but by moving
slowly, I got into the rhythm of intermittent fasting without feeling
significant hunger or experiencing irritability.
Choose Your Window
After easing toward intermittent fasting, select an 8-hour window and limit
your food intake to that time span. Popular time windows include:
Noon to 8 p.m. = Your eating window
8 p.m. to noon the next day = Your fasting window
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. = Your eating window
6 p.m. to 10 a.m. the next day = Your fasting window
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. = Your eating window
5 p.m. to 9 a.m. the next day = Your fasting window
Experiment to find the best times for you.
Stay Flexible
Many people choose the 16:8 pattern, but that may not work for everyone.
If you find that a 14:10 or even an 18:6 works better for you, that is
completely okay. The only eating pattern that works is the one that works
for you and your schedule.
Consult the Meal Plans
It’s important to follow the nutritional guidance offered in Chapter 7. This
includes the recommended amount of protein per day. During the fat-
burning period of a fast, you can be at risk of breaking down protein to use
as an energy source if you’re not eating enough during your eating window.
Focus on eating an ample supply of protein to prevent any kind of muscle
loss or breakdown during your fast.
Your body also needs a good balance of other nutrients, including fruits
and vegetables and healthy, complex carbohydrate sources in the right

ratios.
The Galveston Diet’s meal plans and nutritional principles will help you
fill up on nutrient-rich foods; they are the perfect complement to
intermittent fasting. Follow these guidelines, and you’ll be successful.
Stay Hydrated
Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is important, but it is extremely
important during your fasting window. When you don’t eat, you’re missing
out on the water that would be in your foods, so you’ll need to drink more
fluids to compensate. In addition, drinking more fluids helps keep you full
during periods of fasting, as well as reducing food cravings.
Avoid Temptation
Having tempting foods around—foods that trigger your desire to overeat—
will make fasting unnecessarily hard. The look and smell of foods can set
off your appetite and make you crave them. It’s best to remove these foods
from your kitchen and other places.
Make Use of Your Spare Time
When you fast, you gain more spare time in your schedule from those times
during which you’d normally be preparing food and eating it. This
newfound time is the perfect opportunity to do something you love, such as
reading, listening to music, or going for a walk.
Get Plenty of Sleep
Numerous studies have shown that getting a good night’s sleep suppresses
your appetite and tames out-of-control hunger and cravings. Shoot for 6 to 8
hours of sleep each night. Remember, the hours you sleep count toward
your fasting hours, so take advantage of this no-temptation, no-hunger time!
Exercise
Exercise can increase the benefits of intermittent fasting. Light exercise
enhances circulation, improves energy levels, and lifts your mood. The
timing of your exercise is up to you; experiment with what times of the day
work best for you and fit your schedule.
Rest and Relaxation

Make and take time for relaxation every day. It invigorates your body and
mind, promotes a positive outlook, and improves your thinking and
memory. In addition, a more relaxed life supports good health, which in
turn leads to greater productivity and happiness.
Reward Yourself
After you hit your IF goals for the day, week, or month, reward yourself.
Whether it is carving out consistent time to do something that you love, or
taking a soothing bubble bath, going for a walk, calling a friend, meditating
or journaling, or even getting a manicure or facial, find something that
brings you joy. Rewarding yourself after reaching a goal is important! Do
not discount it.
Hot Flash: 5 Big Myths About Intermittent Fasting
As with any popular trend, there are a lot of untruths floating
around about intermittent fasting. To sort fact from fiction, let’s
debunk some of the most prevalent myths about IF.
Myth #1: Intermittent fasting just means that you skip breakfast.
It’s true that most people choose a window of fasting that means
skipping breakfast at their usual time. However, you can schedule
your eating window so you have an earlier dinner and therefore can
have breakfast, even if it’s just a little later in the morning. For
example, if you finish eating at 6 p.m., you can break your fast and
enjoy breakfast at 10 a.m. the next day. This still keeps you on the
16:8 fasting schedule. For many people, this allows greater
flexibility and may align better with their hunger patterns.
Myth #2: Intermittent fasting is appropriate for anyone.
Despite its many benefits, intermittent fasting is not right for
everyone. I do not advise this strategy for those with eating
disorders, anyone who is currently underweight, or someone who
has type 1 diabetes. In addition, you should not begin an
intermittent fasting routine while you are pregnant or
breastfeeding. Children and teens generally should not fast,
because they are still growing. Nor is it a good idea for people

newly diagnosed with diabetes, a chronic disease, in a weakened
state from surgery, or while being treated for a health concern.
Myth #3: You can eat anything you want during your eating window.
Your eating window is not a time to feast on less nutritious or
processed foods. It’s a time to concentrate on healthy choices.
Intermittent fasting is a key part of the Galveston Diet, but
remember that it works synergistically with the other two actions,
including healthy food choices, to give you the best results.
Myth #4: Intermittent fasting slows your metabolism.
On the contrary, fasting, especially intermittent fasting, has been
shown to boost metabolism. Your metabolism is the process by
which food is turned into fuel in your body. When you fast, your
body is given hormonal advantages that enhance your metabolic
health.
In fact, certain hormones involved in metabolism, such as
norepinephrine and growth hormone, become elevated through
fasting. Not only does fasting help keep the metabolically
important hormones high, but it also makes you more
“metabolically flexible.” This means that your body can adapt to
quickly burning the fuel source, such as carbohydrates or fats, that
is most readily available.
Myth #5: Intermittent fasting makes you hungry.
One reason many people are resistant to intermittent fasting is that
they’re afraid they’ll get too hungry and not be able to stick to a
healthy, nutritious eating plan. It’s true that when you first start
intermittent fasting you might feel hungry; this is why I advise
easing into it. When you gradually increase your fasting window,
you’ll likely find that hunger is very manageable and not
something that distracts you.
Understand, too, that your two main hunger hormones, ghrelin
and leptin, respond positively to intermittent fasting. Ghrelin is a
key hunger hormone that signals your body to eat. Some studies
suggest that intermittent fasting can decrease ghrelin, which would

then make you less hungry. There’s also research that says there’s
an increase in leptin, which is the satiety hormone; that’s the
hormone that says, “Hey, I’m full.”
So, once you get into the full swing of intermittent fasting, you
won’t have to worry about hunger or cravings.
Are You Ready?
Although intermittent fasting is easy, flexible, and effective, making the
commitment might feel challenging at first. You have to be open to making
such a change in your life, believe in your own power to be successful, and
trust that you can and will learn to incorporate it into your lifestyle.
So—are you ready to begin your fat loss and health transformation? Are
you ready to feel better, think more clearly, and feel physically stronger?
Are you ready to prevent disease or reverse health conditions that have
crept up on you in midlife? Are you ready to create a lean, long-lived body?
If you answered yes to even one of those changes, you are indeed ready
to start IF.




CHAPTER 5
Action 2:
Anti-Inflammatory Nutrition
As a physician, I’ve had many patients who were initially unaware that
something really bad was raging in their bodies: chronic inflammation. This
condition can significantly increase the risk of developing diseases like
arthritis, asthma, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and more. We also know
that if you are overweight or obese, your body is chronically inflamed.
Here’s the really great news: many recent studies have shown the power
of anti-inflammatory foods to fight inflammation, control weight, and
improve health. The key is simply to concentrate on anti-inflammatory
nutrition. Stay the course, and the results of eating in this manner will kick
in, and you’ll begin to feel much better and start losing weight.
Inflammation: Acute versus Chronic
Inflammation is a normal, defensive process that allows the immune system
to fight what science calls a “stimulus.” That stimulus can be an injury, an
infection, a foreign body, an ingested irritant, or even cancer. As a very
simple example, think of a sprained ankle that gets red and swollen, or a cut
on your finger that becomes tender. The redness, pain, or swelling are
normal acute responses of the inflammatory system.
With acute inflammation, the walls of tiny capillaries widen and become
more permeable, allowing white blood cells to flood the damaged tissue. As
the blood flows in, the affected area swells. This places pressure on
surrounding nerves and triggers pain. But once the offending stimulus has
been removed or destroyed, the tissue heals.
Acute inflammation is a necessary process—one of the primary
mechanisms that protect our bodies against the thousand environmental

attacks we receive every day. It serves a vital role in our maintenance and
repair system. Without it, we can’t survive.
Chronic inflammation is something altogether different. It is a slow,
ongoing, and destructive process by which the body produces chemicals
that inflame tissues.
Chronic inflammation often occurs below the pain threshold, meaning
the brain does not register that it is happening. It can therefore go unnoticed
and unchecked by the body for very long periods of time. This is why
persistent inflammation is so dangerous and plays a role in at least seven of
the top ten causes of death for adults in the United States.
Take heart disease, for example, which is the leading killer of American
women. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)—those particles of “bad”
cholesterol—can travel into the inner walls of arteries. There, they provoke
an inflammatory response that can create blood clots and eventually plaques
that block arteries.
Another chronic condition that has been linked to inflammation is type 2
diabetes, in which people can’t adequately use insulin. Over time, without
treatment, their organs begin to fail as the glucose builds to dangerous
levels in the blood. Researchers have found macrophages (a type of white
blood cell) in the pancreas of people with type 2 diabetes. The macrophages
release inflammatory molecules that impair insulin activity.
Inflammation is a possible driver in Alzheimer’s disease, too. This
disease results mostly from the buildup of amyloid and tau proteins in the
brain. Specialized cells called microglia patrol the brain, looking for signs
of infection or inflammation caused by these offending proteins. When
they’re found, the microglia get rid of them. In doing so, they also dispatch
pro-inflammatory chemicals called cytokines that activate other microglia.
Normally, this cytokine release is short-lived; but in Alzheimer’s, the
microglia become overactive, increasing their production of cytokines,
simultaneously clearing less, and leading to brain inflammation. The result
is more and more damage to brain cells, which can gradually lead to
Alzheimer’s disease.
For women, the decline in estrogen during perimenopause and
menopause instigates inflammation in many different organs, especially the
gut lining. An unhealthy gut lining may develop small cracks or holes,
allowing partially digested food, toxins, and other substances to penetrate

the tissues beneath it. This triggers inflammation that can lead to problems
in the digestive tract and beyond—even in the bones.
The body views inflammation as a stressor, so the way it responds to the
stress is to halt normal bone turnover in favor of bone loss, possibly leading
to osteoporosis. In other words, anything that causes inflammation may
have an effect on bone health.
Decreasing estrogen levels lead to other inflammatory problems, too.
These include brain inflammation and a resulting cognitive decline—
specifically, verbal memory (hello, brain fog). They also lead to
inflammation in the muscles, which ultimately results in loss of muscle
mass and strength, otherwise known as sarcopenia.
What’s more, researchers believe that declining levels of estrogen cause
joint pain during menopause. When you’re younger, estrogen protects your
joints by keeping inflammation down. As estrogen levels begin to drop off
during perimenopause, however, there is less of the hormone to protect the
joints, and pain is often the result.
Weight gain brought on by hormonal changes also contributes to
inflammation. There is clear evidence that fat cells, especially visceral fat
cells (“belly fat”) around the middle of the body, add to chronic
inflammation by creating extra cytokines and elevating C-reactive protein
(a marker of inflammation in the blood).
Clearly, chronic inflammation is a menace, which is why understanding
and controlling it has become a central focus of modern medical
preventative treatment.
The Joy of Change
Every medical condition has a story, and Anna’s began with some
serious issues. By the time she entered midlife and turned 50, she
was suffering from osteoarthritis, stenosis (a narrowing of the
spine), and degenerative disc disease. She was slowly gaining
weight and dealing with other symptoms. For example, her brain
seemed enveloped in a gray fog, and she began getting headaches
and feeling exhausted. It all added up to a weird sense that her
mind and body weren’t in sync.
Frustrated, worried, and confused, Anna consulted a
gastrointestinal doctor and was tested for food allergies. It turned

out that she had a strong sensitivity to gluten, grains, legumes,
some starches, and certain additives in foods.
As I heard Anna’s story, I suspected that she had a lot of
inflammation going on in her body, and it was related to her diet.
Fortunately, Anna realized this too, and she got onto the road to
recovery by following the Galveston Diet and eliminating
inflammation-causing substances from her diet.
As she told us, “My official start date was June 1, 2020, and I
weighed 159.9 pounds. Today is August 20, 2020, and I am at
146.1 pounds and feeling stronger and less inflamed.”
The Power of Anti-Inflammatory Nutrition
The typical American diet, in particular, features an endless rotation of
processed, highly inflammatory foods. This type of eating not only fuels
chronic inflammation but also damages the heart, kidneys, brain, waistline,
and more.
Small wonder, then, that the most effective way to prevent and reverse
the chronic inflammation associated with these diseases and aging is
through good nutrition. To suppress chronic inflammation, you’ll want to
eat less of certain substances—or avoid them altogether.
Omega-6 Fats Versus Omega-3 Fats
I tell my patients all that time that it is essential to lower the omega-6:
omega-3 ratio. But why? What is the difference between these two types of
fatty acids?
Biochemically speaking, omega-3 and omega-6 are both polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs). The main difference between them has to do with their
chemical makeup. Omega-3 refers to the position of the final double bond
in the chemical structure, which is three carbon atoms from the “omega,” or
tail end of the molecular chain. In omega-6 fats, the last double bond is six
carbons from the tail end. From a practical standpoint, an unbalanced ratio
of these fats can provoke inflammatory processes in the body.
In Paleolithic times, early humans probably evolved and thrived on a 1:1
ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, although we don’t know for sure.
However, our genes have not changed much since then. Fast-forward to

modern times, and the ratio in the Western diet, on average, is an
astounding 20:1. In other words, we’re eating a lot more omega-6 fats in
proportion to the omega-3 fats we eat.
Where are we getting so many omega-6 fats? Mostly from many refined
vegetable oils, such as sunflower, corn, soybean, and cottonseed oils. They
are also plentiful in many snack foods, cookies, crackers, salad dressings,
and fast foods. When omega-6 fats are broken down during normal body
processes, the by-products trigger inflammation in the body. The more
omega-6 fats you consume, the higher your risk is for chronic inflammation
—and the diseases it causes.
As harmful as too many omega-6 fats can be, they become even worse
when converted from liquid to solid or semi-solid—that is, hydrogenated or
partially hydrogenated—as in the production of margarine or shortening.
During the hardening, they change into trans fats, which make the
membranes of cells rigid, inflexible, and essentially dysfunctional. Indeed,
trans fats do a lot of damage in the body. They increase inflammation,
especially in people who are very overweight or obese. They depress the
immune system, lower HDL cholesterol (the good kind), and raise LDL
cholesterol (the dangerous kind), as well as other bad deeds.
To protect yourself against inflammation, especially from domination by
omega-6 fats and trans fats, eat more foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty
acids. That will counter the effects of too many omega-6 fats in your body.
You can obtain omega-3s from fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, and
sardines, as well as some plant foods like flax seeds and walnuts. Grass-fed
animals are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, too. If you don’t like fish
or don’t eat it very often, you might need to supplement with an omega-3
source like fish oil.
Another action to restore the intake balance between the two fats is to
ease off processed seed and vegetable oils that are high in omega-6s, as well
as the processed foods that contain them. Also, avoid trans fats such as
margarine and shortening.
Added Sugar
By “added sugar” I mean the kind that is added during the cooking or
processing of foods (such as sucrose, dextrose, or high-fructose corn syrup),
products packaged as sweeteners (such as table sugar), sugars from syrups
and honey, sugars from concentrated fruit juices, and the sugar you put in

your own food. Added sugars do not include the naturally occurring sugars
found in fruits, vegetables, and dairy foods.
In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended that no more than
10 percent—and ideally less than 5 percent—of an adult’s daily calories
should come from added sugar. Put into perspective, that means an average
adult who eats 2,000 calories daily should consume no more than 6
teaspoons (2 tablespoons) of sugar a day, or about 25 grams—that’s the
amount you’d get in a generous schmear of hazelnut spread, but quite a bit
less than what is in a can of non-diet cola.
But we’re eating a lot more sugar. Today, the average American ingests
more than 19 teaspoons (6⅓ tablespoons), or almost 80 grams, of added
sugar every day!
Too much added sugar causes inflammation in multiple ways. First, after
you have eaten sugar, your blood glucose spikes. When this happens, pro-
inflammatory chemicals get dispersed throughout your body, fueling
inflammation. Then, your body produces insulin, which itself is a pro-
inflammatory hormone.
Consumed sugar also interferes with a process called phagocytosis. This
occurs when white blood cells attempt to destroy foreign particles or
pathogens, such as bacteria or an infected cell, by engulfing them. In
humans, phagocytosis protects the body and is a vital aspect of the immune
system.
The Food and Drug Administration now requires “added sugars” to be
listed on the labels of all food packaging, listed under carbohydrates. This
has made it a little easier to identify the added sugar in ingredient lists. But
there are upwards of fifty names for sugar appearing on these labels. So,
don’t just look for the word sugar. Look for any type of sugar, syrup, nectar,
or anything ending in -ose. If you avoid foods containing added sugar,
especially processed foods, you’ll greatly reduce your overall intake of
sugar.
Hot Flash: What No One Tells You About Artificial
Sweeteners
Artificial sweeteners—the kind that you add to your coffee and that
manufacturers add to packaged foods—can trigger inflammation
by promoting pro-inflammatory changes in gut bacteria. Basically,

artificial sweeteners cause previously healthy gut bacteria to
become diseased. Then they invade the gut wall and make it more
porous and leaky—a situation that potentially leads to serious
health issues.
Read food labels carefully, because artificial sweeteners are
lurking in many foods. You probably know the brand names of
typical artificial sweeteners, but manufacturers often list them
under their generic names on food labels. Aspartame, sucralose,
and acesulfame-K (ace-K) are examples of generic names you may
find listed.
But here’s another thing that may not be common knowledge: as
you taper off your use of artificial sweeteners, your taste buds get a
chance to relearn what real sweetness is, and they’ll thank you for
it! Eventually, you’ll start to enjoy the natural sweetness of real
foods rather than the overpowering sweetness of processed food
products and diet drinks.
Added Nitrites and Nitrates in Processed Foods
Nitrites and nitrates are both forms of nitrogen. The difference between
them lies in their chemical structures: nitrates have three oxygen atoms,
while nitrites have two oxygen atoms. Both nitrates and nitrites occur
naturally in certain vegetables, like leafy greens, celery, and cabbage.
Although the nitrites and nitrates that occur naturally in vegetables can be
helpful, there are also synthetic versions of both compounds, and these are
added to foods such as cured meats (bacon, ham, hot dogs, deli meats) as
preservatives. After you ingest these chemicals, they can form compounds
called nitrosamines, which are inflammation-generating chemicals that can
cause many types of cancer. Man-made nitrites and nitrates are harmful to
the body and should be avoided.
One other big problem with these processed foods is that they trigger the
formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which, you guessed
it, increase inflammation in the body. So, it’s best to cut back on processed
meats and eat them only sparingly, if at all. You can also purchase nitrate-
free, uncured meats.
Artificial Colors, Flavorings, and Preservatives

If you read the ingredient label of just about any food in your kitchen
pantry, in your fridge, or at the supermarket, you’ll spot lots of food
additives. Thousands and thousands of additives are put into various foods
and food products. They’re used to enhance the flavor, appearance, or
texture of a product, or to extend its shelf life.
The problem with additives is that the body does not recognize them as
food. Instead, they are viewed as foreign. Your body then creates
inflammation as part of an immune response to defend against what it
perceives as an invader.
The simplest ways to avoid food additives is to reduce your intake of
processed foods, make more foods from scratch, and buy organic foods as
much as possible.
Fried Foods
You might love fried foods, but your body doesn’t! The oil used to fry foods
is usually high in omega-6 fatty acids. Eating fried foods on a regular basis
can then upset the ratio between omega-3 and omega-6 fats, which—as we
have discussed—triggers inflammation.
In addition, many fried foods—like French fries and potato chips—are
deep-fried at extremely high temperatures, a process that gives off an
inflammatory chemical called acrylamide. The National Toxicology
Program’s Report on Carcinogens considers acrylamide to be a possible
carcinogen.
I admit that nothing beats the mouthwatering crunch of hot fried foods.
But there are alternatives that allow us to keep the crunch but lose the bad
fats and toxins in fried foods: oven-bake your fries and other dishes, or try
air-frying (one study showed that air-frying lowers the amount of
acrylamide in fried potatoes by 90 percent).
Saturated Fats
When I was a geologist working for an oil company, I used to go out to
lunch with my coworkers. This was more than 25 years ago, when the keto
and ultra-low-carb diets hit the scene and were all the rage. A few of my
work buddies were on these diets, so at lunch I’d watch them eat
hamburgers (no buns) piled with bacon and cheese or they would wolf
down big slabs of steak but never any vegetables. They were losing weight,
for sure, but at what cost with all that saturated fat?

Cheese, fatty beef, and butter all contain a lot of saturated fat, which is
highly inflammatory when eaten in excess. That inflammation occurs in a
couple of different ways. First, saturated fat can stimulate inflammation
through molecules called toll-like receptors (TLR). Under normal
circumstances, TLRs form an elite force that screens potential invaders in
the body to see if they’re bacterial, viral, or fungal. If they find evidence of
any of these invaders, they signal the immune system to mount an attack.
One of the TLR weapons, TLR4, is designed to sense bacteria.
Unfortunately, this protective mechanism can go wrong if TLR4 is
exposed to too much saturated fat. When this happens, TLR4 sends the
wrong signal, recognizing saturated fat as the invader. This sets off
inflammation, particularly in the gut, that breaks down the gut lining,
leading to leaky gut. In that situation, harmful substances escape from the
gut, contributing to immune problems and poor infection control.
Saturated fat also stimulates the production of inflammatory agents called
prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These can cause widespread destruction of
joints and the inflammation associated with artery clogging. A high intake
of saturated fats is associated with obesity, which also feeds the
inflammatory process.
Additionally, women need to be aware that if they eat a lot of saturated
fat, it influences their hormones, which may promote breast cancer. Excess
saturated fat can generate higher levels of circulating estradiol, a potential
cancer promoter when abnormally elevated in the body.
You don’t have to entirely eliminate saturated fats on the Galveston Diet.
As you will see in the pages ahead, I suggest you exercise a little caution
and balance your intake of saturated fats with healthy fats such as olive oil,
coconut oil, avocados, and so forth.
There are number of easy nutritional hacks to help you reduce and
manage your intake of saturated fats:
Eat leaner cuts of beef and pork, and trim as much visible fat as
possible.
Enjoy more fish and chicken.
Choose a 90/10 blend for ground beef, or consider substituting ground
turkey or chicken for ground beef.
Remove the skin from chicken before cooking.

Instead of sour cream, try a full-fat plain yogurt or a whip of yogurt
and a full-fat cottage cheese.
In recipes, use cheeses that are naturally lower in saturated fat, such as
cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, Parmesan, feta, or goat cheese.
Remember to always check those food labels on reduced-fat products to
be sure any fat removed has not been replaced with sugar or other unsavory
ingredients!
Excessive Alcohol
Chronic heavy drinking—more than five to seven drinks weekly—tends to
disrupt the balance between the “good” and “bad” bacteria in your gut. This
imbalance creates inflammation and steals the health of your immune
system. Alcohol also promotes the overgrowth of bad bacteria, which
further harms your gut, weakening its lining. The gut then becomes porous
and allows harmful bacteria and toxins to leak out into the bloodstream to
reach the organs. Excessive alcohol use on a regular basis can also lead to
organ damage.
It’s wise to restrict your alcohol consumption to about one drink a day.
This translates to one 5-ounce glass of wine, a 12-ounce bottle of beer, or
1.5 ounces of hard liquor.

Focus on Foods That Heal
This chapter has covered the main foods that cause chronic inflammation.
Let’s now get acquainted with the foods that actively fight inflammation in
the body! These are the heart and soul of the Galveston Diet.
Some of the best tools to combat chronic inflammation comes not from
the pharmacy but from the grocery store. Much research has found that
components of some foods or beverages have anti-inflammatory effects,
and you’ll enjoy most of these foods on the Galveston Diet.
Among the most powerful of these components are the antioxidants,
valued for their potential in fighting cellular damage. An antioxidant is a
substance that protects cells from the damage caused by free radicals. A
free radical is a molecule that has lost part of itself—that is, it has lost one
of its electrically charged electrons that normally orbit in pairs. To restore
that balance, the radical steals an electron from nearby molecules. In doing
so, it inflicts damage on cell membranes, leaving those cells to disintegrate.
Thus, the production of free radicals leads to various inflammatory-
associated diseases.
But we have antioxidants to the rescue! Research shows that antioxidants
may help prevent certain cancers, reduce cholesterol levels, and increase
immune function. They donate an electron to a free radical without
becoming harmed in the process. Antioxidants thus put an end to the
destructive, pro-inflammatory rampage of free radicals.
Vitamin antioxidants include vitamins A, C, and E, while mineral
antioxidants include zinc, selenium, copper, and manganese. Inflammation-
fighting foods to choose for these antioxidants include the following:

Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and cranberries are
on the A-list as sources of fruit-derived antioxidants.
Artichokes, kale, and bell peppers are among the richest sources of
antioxidants in veggies. Other powerful sources include asparagus,
beets, broccoli, red cabbage, and tomatoes.
Walnuts, pistachios, pecans, hazelnuts, and almonds are high in
antioxidants, as are seeds.
Legumes—such as kidney beans, edamame, and lentils—pack an
antioxidant punch.
Many spices have amazing antioxidant characteristics, especially
cloves, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and any fresh herb.
Coffee, tea, and red wine (in moderation) are rich in antioxidants.
•Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids are powerful sources of anti-
inflammatory components. These include fish such as salmon and
mackerel. (If fish is not an option or you don’t eat it often or at all,
supplementing with fish oil is a good plan B.)
To enrich your diet with antioxidants, shoot for variety. No one single
food or food group should be your sole priority. Instead, incorporate lots of
different fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and spices into your diet.
The Galveston Diet meal plans (see Chapter 8) will lend a healthy variety
to your eating. They will provide you with a framework for your meals and
will inspire you to create your own meals and snacks.

CHAPTER 6
Action 3:
Fuel Refocus
I’ve met many women who were literally addicted to processed
carbohydrates, especially foods high in added sugar. They’d sprinkle sugar
on their already sugary cereal in the morning, snack on chocolate nibs
throughout the day, and eat ice cream after dinner. They just didn’t seem to
be able to get enough sweets.
And no wonder. Sugar is lurking everywhere, and its lure is powerful.
Most food manufacturers don’t make it easy on us. In fact, they are at the
root of the sugar problem. There are more than 600,000 processed foods in
grocery stores, 80 percent of which contain added hidden sugar. As I
mentioned earlier, the average American consumes 19 teaspoons of sugar a
day. One serving of a popular commercial pasta sauce has more sugar than a
serving of Oreo cookies! Sweetened yogurts may be filled with more sugar
than a can of soda.
Debate has raged recently about whether junk food—the super-
processed, ultra-palatable stuff—is addictive in the same way that heroin or
cocaine is addictive. After all, many people often feel overwhelmed with
cravings that drive them to seek out sweets and devour them in a flash.
Well, the verdict is starting to come in: a 2018 study found that higher
sugar, higher glycemic foods can indeed be addictive—and in animal
studies, they have been shown to be more addictive than cocaine.
Naturally, there are consequences—serious ones. Processed
carbohydrates and added sugar are considered the main detrimental
additives in our diets. They’re often cited as the lead contributors to various
chronic, inflammation-related illnesses, from obesity to diabetes to
Alzheimer’s disease.

Today, a growing body of science suggests that those who are
overweight, obese, pre-diabetic or diabetic, or even addicted to processed
carbs might do best on a diet that is higher in total fat and lower in
carbohydrates. In fact, the proof is overwhelmingly in favor of limiting
carbohydrates, increasing good fats, and eating moderate amounts of
protein.
This is exactly what the Fuel Refocus phase of the Galveston Diet is all
about.
What Is Fuel Refocus?
Our bodies prefer to burn glucose for fuel, derived from the carbohydrates
in our diets through a process called gluconeogenesis, which takes place in
the liver. Once our sources of glucose are burned up, our bodies then switch
to burning body fat for fuel.
But remember, the American diet is loaded with carbohydrates (e.g.,
bread, pasta, rice, desserts, and added sugars). These flood the body with
glucose, which stimulates insulin release. Insulin is the main hormonal
driver of fat storage in the body. So, when you eat that way, your body
never switches into fat burning mode and yet also stores more of it! It’s a
lose-lose situation.
To combat this, it’s vital to refocus your macros (protein, carbohydrates,
and fat) and adjust your percentages to those that activate fat burning and
stimulate the body to rely on fat as its main source of fuel. When you
refocus your macros and adjust your percentages away from the typical
American diet and toward percentages that encourage fat burning, your
body creates ketone bodies in the process. These fatty acids are a form of
fuel that help the body burn fat, instead of using glucose (sugar) from carbs.
This biochemistry is the essence of Action 3: Fuel Refocus.
The Macros in Fuel Refocus
The macronutrient ratio of the typical American diet is as follows: 50
percent of calories from carbohydrates, 15 percent from protein, and 35
percent from fat.
We’re going to change that. On the Galveston Diet, you’ll adjust your
macros to enhance fat burning, fueling your body with healthy fats and
protein and high-quality carbs in percentages that encourage the body to

utilize fat for fuel. Those percentages are as follows: 70 percent healthy
fats, 20 percent lean protein, and 10 percent carbohydrates.
The daily meal plans in this program are calibrated for these macros, so
it’s easy to meet your macro goals. When you begin to plan meals on your
own, you can track your own macros using your nutrition tracker (see page
55).
Here’s an overview of the approved options to help you meet your
macros.
70 Percent Healthy Fats
These include avocado, avocado oil, coconut oil, olive oil, olives, seeds
(especially chia and flax seeds), butter, raw nuts (especially almonds,
macadamia nuts, pecans, and walnuts), nut butters (no sugar added), and
mayonnaise (olive oil or avocado oil based).
20 Percent Lean Protein
Choose from grass-fed animal protein (beef, bison, chicken, lamb, pork,
turkey), wild-caught fish and seafood, anchovies, sardines, eggs, nitrate-free
beef jerky, and protein powder (limited ingredient, low sugar, low-carb).
10 Percent Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are generally classified as two types, complex and simple.
Complex carbohydrates are high-fiber foods, which improve your digestion
and overall gut health. They also help stabilize your blood sugar, keep your
energy at an even level, and help you feel satisfied longer after meals. They
are less likely to be deposited as fat.
Examples of complex carbs are vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole
grains. My favorites are apples, artichokes, asparagus, bell peppers, beets,
berries, broccoli, broccoli slaw, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, leafy greens,
nuts and seeds, and pickles. These are carbs to enjoy.
Carbs to avoid are simple carbs. These are smaller molecules of sugar
that are digested quickly by the body. They cause a rapid spike in insulin. If
not burned off right away, they can be converted to body fat. They are
typically found in foods rich in added sugars or processed white flour that
has been stripped of fiber and nutrients. Examples are candy and other
sweets, bread and other baked goods, and various processed foods.

Once you begin the Galveston Diet for Life program, in Chapter 10—
which guides you through maintenance—you’ll refocus your fuel again but
over several weeks in order to stabilize your weight and increase your
intake of anti-inflammatory foods. For example, you’ll:
1. Start with one or more weeks at 60 percent fat, 20 percent protein, and
20 percent carbohydrates.
2. Progress to additional weeks at 50 percent fat, 20 percent protein, and
30 percent carbohydrate.
3. Stabilize long term at 40 percent fat, 20 percent protein, and 40 percent
carbohydrates. These percentages are those that you’ll use forever,
after you’ve reached a size you like and are feeling really healthy and
energetic.
There’s lots to look forward to!
Hot Flash: Meet Your Carbohydrate Macronutrient
Goals with Low-Starch Veggies
As you track your carbohydrate macros, understand that there are
two main categories of vegetables: starchy and non-starchy.
Starchy veggies include sweet potatoes, corn, beans, and legumes
(beans, peas, lentils), while non-starchy types include broccoli,
cauliflower, tomatoes, and zucchini.
Both starchy and non-starchy vegetables are complex
carbohydrates, but as the category names indicate, the key
distinction between the two lies in their total starch content.
Cooked starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, pack about 15 grams
of carbs and 80 calories per ½ cup, whereas non-starchy types like
broccoli contain about 5 grams of carbs and 25 calories in an
equivalent portion. Also, starchy vegetables can raise your blood
sugar levels faster than non-starchy veggies.
Although both forms of carbs are high in fiber, antioxidants,
vitamins, and minerals, if weight loss is your goal, you will want to
want to modify your intake of starchy vegetables in order to
achieve your daily carb macros and burn fat steadily.
The table on page 106 lists some examples from both categories.

Starchy Non-Starchy
Corn Artichokes Cucumbers
Parsnips Asparagus Eggplant
Peas Green beans Mushrooms
Plantain Italian beans Onions
Potatoes Peppers (all) Broccoli
Squash Salad greens Brussels sprouts
Sweet potatoes Cauliflower Spinach
Succotash Kale Sprouts
Yams Carrots Wax beans
Zucchini Tomatoes
The Important Distinction Between Net Carbs and Total Carbs
On the Galveston Diet, you’ll be tracking net carbs. Net carbs are the total
grams of carbohydrates in any given food minus its grams of fiber.
There’s a pretty simple and easy way to figure this out. If you look at the
Nutrition Facts label of a given food, you’ll see the total carbohydrates per
serving are listed. Indented under total carbohydrates, you’ll find the
amount of fiber and the amount of total sugar, which includes added sugars.
All these components make up the total carbohydrate number, but because
fiber is not absorbed in the digestive process, we’ll subtract them from the
total:
Total carbohydrates - Fiber = Net carbohydrates
The idea behind using net carbs is that our body digests each type of
carbohydrate differently. Net carbs are the carbohydrates that you digest
and use for energy; as mentioned, the remaining fiber passes through the
digestive tract without being absorbed and thus does not elevate your blood
sugar. Low-net-carb foods do not have a significant impact on your blood
sugar and are therefore likely to help support weight loss.

Calculating Net Carbs
Remember, to calculate net carbs you simply subtract the grams of
fiber from the grams of total carbohydrates. For the food whose
nutritional label is given above, 37 grams (total carbohydrate)
minus 4 grams (dietary fiber) equals 33 grams (net carbs).
The Common Challenges with Fuel Refocus
As you refocus your macros, you may be worrying that you’ll miss pasta or
bread or potatoes, or you’ll worry about your sweet tooth getting the best of
you. But let me reassure you. Your cravings will fall off (along with pounds
and inches), you’ll feel more energized, and healthier, and you’ll feel
completely satiated on the Galveston Diet. I can say this with confidence
because so many women I’ve heard from have told me so!
Still, it’s important to understand that your body has been fueled by
carbohydrates for most of your life. You are now asking your metabolism to

switch from burning carbs to burning stored fat—which means you’re
likely to face a few challenges. But don’t get discouraged! You are not
alone in feeling some or all the following as you get started on the
Galveston Diet.
Impatience with Fat Adaptation
When you start the program you’ll be training your body to adapt to
burning fat as its main fuel source rather than carbohydrates. This doesn’t
happen overnight, however. Studies show that becoming fat-adapted
happens over weeks, not days. Most people actually need three to four
weeks to reach peak fat-burning adaptation. What this means as a practical
matter is that you may not see or feel big results for several weeks. Be
patient! Once your body adapts to burning fat, the changes will come fast!
Carbohydrate Withdrawal
If you’ve been eating lots of complex carbs, you can expect some changes
to your mood and energy levels when you switch your macronutrient intake
to 10 percent carbohydrates. Indeed, this restriction can produce some
withdrawal effects in the early stages. For instance, you may experience:
fatigue
headaches
cough
sniffles
irritability
nausea
Ironically, if you experience any of these symptoms, it’s actually a good
sign. It means that at one time your body was dependent on burning glucose
for fuel. Now your metabolism is shifting to rely on fat for fuel. You are
simply going through withdrawal from sugar and high-carbohydrate foods
and are moving into fat-burning mode (fat adaptation!).
Carbohydrate withdrawal is not fun, but hang in there. You can minimize
the side effects, even if you can’t eliminate them completely. One of the
best ways is to replenish your electrolytes. Electrolytes include important
minerals such as magnesium, potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, and
chloride, and they are vital in that they enable cells to generate energy,

maintain the stability of their membranes, and function optimally in
general. They also generate electricity, assist muscle contraction, transport
water and fluids within the body, and participate in many other activities.
You can replenish your electrolytes by drinking adequate water
throughout the day and introducing foods that are high in electrolytes into
your diet.
To get enough potassium, for example, enjoy lots of green leafy
vegetables and avocados. Honestly, I recommend eating at least one
avocado a day. As for magnesium, nuts such as walnuts, almonds,
pistachios, and pecans, as well as pumpkin and sunflower seeds, are
wonderful sources and easy to add to any meal or snack.
Other electrolytes (especially calcium) are plentiful in green vegetables,
and you can get sodium and chloride from gently salting your foods.
Proteins such as tuna and chicken are rich in phosphorus.
Not Getting Enough Fat
Perhaps in the past you’ve been told to cut back on fats. But on this plan, fat
is your new energy source. You need it. If you don’t get enough fat, your
energy levels will suffer, and this plan may become difficult.
The best way to think of the Galveston Diet is that it’s not simply a
lower-carb diet; it’s a high-healthy-fat diet. You may need to change your
mindset from “eliminate carbs” to “get enough fat.”
With Fuel Refocus, about 70 percent of your calories should come from
fat; that means enjoying foods such as eggs, uncured bacon, nuts, seeds,
avocados, avocado oil, olive oil, coconut oil, and butter.
Avoiding Hidden Carbs
Carbs and added sugar are sneaky, and avoiding them can be quite a
challenge. Many foods hide significantly more sugar and processed
carbohydrates than you might realize, so it is important not only to read the
nutrition labels but also to understand how the food was prepared and figure
out how many carbs you’re eating.
Carbs aren’t just lurking in the obvious foods; they’re also hiding out in
seemingly innocent foods. Here’s a short list of places where you’ll find
hidden carbs and added sugar:
Reduced-fat foods

Liquid eggs
Sauces
Condiments
Peanut butter
Salad dressings
Protein and energy bars
Hot Flash: Carb Swaps for Success
Here are some delicious substitutions for high-carb foods that will

Bread Lettuce wraps or low-carb tortillas
Breading Grated cheese or almond flour
Chips Parmesan cheese crisps
Mashed potatoes Mashed cauliflower
Pasta Zoodles or other spiralized non-
starchy vegetables
Rice Cauliflower rice
Soda Sparkling water
Wheat flour Almond flour
Consuming Enough Protein
The challenge of eating enough protein is in figuring out when you should
eat it.
Most people eat protein at just one meal—say, dinner—but to maintain
muscle at any age, it’s best to eat your protein throughout your 8-hour
feeding window. This helps prevent muscle loss, which is important for
women approaching and entering midlife. It also helps the hormones that
control hunger and satiety, leptin and ghrelin, stay in balance.

And you don’t have to necessarily eat protein after a workout. You may
have heard that protein is needed 30 minutes to 1 hour after exercising. I
believed this advice for years, until I found out that it was based on a study
involving 25-year-old male athletes. Those subjects who took in protein
within 30 minutes of working out gained more muscle mass when
compared to those who did not (although they still gained muscle, just not
as much). These findings are irrelevant to us because they apply to young
men. Plus, most of us are not looking to gain a crazy amount of muscle.
For some guidelines, aim to eat 25 to 30 grams of protein, or 3 ounces, at
each of your meals and 10 to 20 grams of protein, or 1.5 ounces, for your
snacks. Be sure to have your protein along with healthy fats and carbs to
promote fullness.
Don’t overdo your protein intake, however; that is, don’t exceed these
recommendations. If there is excess amino acid floating around in your
bloodstream, your body will convert it to glucose to use for fuel, defeating
the body’s ability to burn fat.
Get Off Sugar in 10 Days—My Sugar Detox
Our bodies get used to a certain amount of sugar. The more sugar we eat,
the more sugar we crave, and I’m talking about “added sugar”—the type
that is added during the processing of foods, as well as table sugar, honey,
syrups, or any sugars that we add to our food. The good news is that it’s
possible to reverse that trend and eliminate your sweet tooth.
The proof for this is in a study published in the American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition. The researchers enlisted 29 volunteers who habitually
drank at least two sugar-sweetened beverages a day. As part of the
experiment, the volunteers were asked to rate the sweetness of some
sweetened puddings and drinks. The researchers then asked half the people
to cut back on their sugar by 40 percent, and they allowed the other half to
continue with their regular diets.
After three months, the people in the study went back to eating whatever
they wanted to eat for a month. The researchers asked the participants to
rate the sweetened puddings and beverages again. The people who had
lowered their intake of sugar thought the pudding and beverages were too
sweet and liked them less. They had actually lost their desire for sweets!
If you have a sweet tooth, this means that after you wean yourself off
sugar, it loses its addictive grip on you. To get you started on that, try my

10-day sugar detox and repeat as necessary.
Day 1. In your journal, write down your goals for breaking your sugar
addiction. For example:
Curb my intake of added sugar.
Educate myself on the health consequences of eating too much sugar.
Take action each day to break my addiction, such as:
• Focusing on whole, unprocessed foods.
• Swapping sodas, juices, sweet tea, and other sugary drinks with
water or unsweetened seltzer.
• Drinking coffee black as a part of intermittent fasting.
• Sweetening plain Greek yogurt with fresh or frozen berries instead
of buying flavored, sugar-loaded yogurt.
• Consuming whole fruits instead of sugar-sweetened foods or
desserts.
• Replacing candy with a homemade trail mix of fruit and nuts.
Day 2. Starting today, track your added sugar intake in your app. You
may be really surprised by the total amounts you start to see. Remember, for
women, the American Heart Association recommends no more than 25
grams of added sugars per day. Seeing how much more than that you are
regularly consuming can be shocking—and motivating!
Day 3. If you’re still drinking soft drinks, sweetened tea or coffee, sweet
cocktail mixers, commercial juices, and so forth, start drinking carbonated
waters infused with citrus fruit or cucumbers instead. Take the additional
step of getting rid of all sweetened beverages you’ve got in the house.
Day 4. Stress affects your food choices and amplifies your cravings for
sweets, so you’ll want to do stress-relieving activities like yoga and
meditation. Also, reach for high-magnesium foods, since magnesium helps
calm the body. Examples are apples, avocados, or almonds. Have those with
an egg or two (rich in brain-friendly vitamins) or fatty fish (packed with
depression-lifting omega-3 fatty acids).
Day 5. Foods high in added sugar, such as packaged foods loaded with
high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), feed your addiction and fuel your hunger
and cravings for more. Today, start creating satiating meals and snacks by
pairing a healthy carb with protein or a healthy fat. Instead of a cookie or

handful of crackers or chips, for example, try pairing an apple with a small
handful of almonds or yellow squash plus hummus.
Day 6. Start a label-reading habit if you haven’t begun already.
Remember, many foods and condiments are sneaky sources of processed
carbs and added sugar. Check the labels of products like salad dressings,
condiments, sauces, and other foods to scan for sneaky carbs.
Day 7. Can’t yet ditch your usual sugary dessert? Ask yourself: Are you
actually hungry or is your nightly sugar fix a hard-to-break habit? If you’re
truly hungry, prepare something high in protein with a healthy fat—say, a
handful of walnuts or unsweetened Greek yogurt with berries and
unsweetened coconut. This kind of combo can replace your nightly dessert
in a highly satisfying way.
Day 8. Little-known fact: Drinking ample water each day can help you
manage sugar cravings. What’s ample? Aim for 64 fluid ounces a day;
that’s 8 cups a day. Feel free to add some citrus or fresh herbs to your water
to make it more interesting.
Day 9. Time to ease off artificial sweeteners, too. They may seem like a
good idea while you’re getting off the added sugar, but they can mess up
your efforts. Research suggests that artificial sweeteners may promote
metabolic changes that actually increase cravings, food intake, and weight
gain. Start easing off these sweeteners by using half the amount you’ve
been accustomed to and halve that amount again every couple of days. If
you still need some sweetness, switch to stevia or erythritol.
Day 10. Congratulations—you’re really on your way. You’re likely
already craving sweets a whole lot less, and maybe you’ve weaned yourself
off added sugars entirely. Keep halving the amount of artificial sweeteners
you’ve been using or ingesting. Keep drinking lots of water. And reflect on
the goals you set out at the beginning of this 10-day process. Record your
successes in your journal and write down how you feel, now that you’ve cut
back on or eliminated added sugars.
The truth is that sugar isn’t required in any diet. You must consume
protein. You must consume quality carbs. You must consume healthy fat.
You don’t need to consume any sugar. The Galveston Diet was developed
with these facts in mind. And the program will help you break your sugar
addiction. I promise you can do it. Once you do, your love affair with added
sugar will be a thing of the past.








CHAPTER 7
The Galveston Diet Nutritional Foundation
The body you’re feeding at age 40, 50, 60, or beyond is hardly the same
body you nourished at age 20. With perimenopause and menopause, and
then postmenopause, everything is changing—your shape, body
composition, metabolism, muscles, bones, and energy, as well as your outer
appearance and your overall health. Because of these changes, you need
specific foods and nutrients not only for weight loss but also for optimal
health for the long run.
Many of us don’t think about turning to food first as a remedy for the
issues that affect us now. More often, we look to medication for help. But
fortunately, we can select the foods that support our hormones, fuel our
bodies, and lessen, reverse, and even alleviate our symptoms.
After guiding tens of thousands of women like you through this program,
I’ve seen direct evidence that the Galveston Diet is the surest way to better
health at midlife, with fewer symptoms and permanent weight loss. You’re
going to be pleasantly surprised at the healing power of this diet!
What thousands of women have discovered is that eating the right foods
in the right ratios is powerful medicine; the results will help your weight,
your hormones, any chronic inflammation, and your overall health.
With this in mind, let’s look at everything you get to eat—and why.
Healthy Fats
Dietary fat is not the bad guy we’ve been led to believe. In the late 1970s, it
was popular to demonize fat. In fact, fat took the rap for causing everything
from high cholesterol to diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. As a result,
low-fat foods popped up everywhere! But the problem with these foods was
that they lacked essential, naturally occurring nutrients and left you feeling
hungry. How did this happen? Food manufacturers added—you guessed it
—sugar for flavor, and so began the downfall of our health.

So, welcome back, fat. On the Galveston Diet, you’ll enjoy plenty of
healthy, “good” fats. These fats can reduce the risk of heart attack and
stroke, support brain function and healthy balanced hormones, improve the
appearance of your skin, help your body heal, and promote an overall sense
of well-being.
Fats are satisfying, too, because they trigger the release of hormones that
can help you feel full—which is one reason why you won’t go hungry on
the Galveston Diet. Fats are beneficial in other ways, too. For example, they
help reverse insulin resistance, decrease the frequency of hot flashes, and
curb the severity of night sweats.
In addition to good oils like olive oil, you can enjoy seeds and nuts as a
fat source. Flax seeds, in particular, are rich in plant-based estrogens,
especially lignans, which promote hormone regulation. They’re also rich in
omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and fiber. Other seeds, like chia and
hemp, are high in omega-3 fats.
Nuts are rich in the fats that are responsible for aiding the health of blood
vessels and in hormone production. Additionally, they help lower
cholesterol and regulate insulin levels while normalizing blood sugar.
Here is a comprehensive list of all the fats you can eat.
Galveston Diet—Approved Fats

Avocado oil
Butter, preferably from grass-fed cows
Coconut flakes (in moderation)

Quality Proteins
Protein is to your body what wood is to your house and steel is to a
skyscraper. It is the body’s fundamental building material, and it plays a
critical role in repair and maintenance. The Galveston Diet is thus a little
higher in protein than many other plans.
If you’ve paid attention to nutritional advice in recent years, maybe
you’ve encountered the pros and cons of eating more protein. Let me set the
record straight: diets higher in protein have been unjustifiably criticized.
The truth is that women need more protein as they get older because their
bodies tend to lose lean muscle and do less repair of old tissue. Much of this
is due to the decline in estrogen, which is linked to losses in muscle mass
and bone strength. To put it bluntly, protein is a lifesaver now. In a
landmark study of women—the Women’s Health Initiative—higher protein
intake was associated with a 32 percent lower risk of frailty and with better
physical function.
Further, protein also stabilizes blood sugar (helpful if you have mood
swings). It influences the release of leptin and ghrelin, the hormones that
regulate your appetite and food intake.
I recommend consuming a variety of protein: chicken, fish, lean meat,
beans and legumes, dairy proteins, and more. Eggs are good, despite what
we were once told. In fact, they are an inexpensive source of protein, and
one of the best foods for balancing hunger and fat-storage hormones,
because they have a positive impact on insulin and ghrelin. Eggs are rich in
vitamin D, as well as in iron and B vitamins. Almost all the nutrients we
need to feel our best and keep our bones strong are packaged in one small
shell.
Fish is another rock star. Packed with inflammation-fighting omega-3
fats, the fattier fish such as wild-caught salmon, herring, mackerel, lake
trout, and sardines stabilize your hunger hormones, leaving you feeling full
for a longer period of time. On top of that, fatty fish are rich in vitamin D,

which helps improve female testosterone levels. Getting these hormonal
levels under control can positively address a woman’s concerns about
weight gain, fatigue, or depression. Fish can also keep the heart healthy and
the skin and hair glowing.
Poultry and beef are excellent protein choices, too. They help promote
the secretion of hormones such as leptin, which provides feelings of satiety.
Animal proteins are also an important source of iron and vitamin B12.
Here’s a rundown of the many protein types you can enjoy on this
program.
Galveston Diet—Approved Proteins
Anchovies
Bacon, uncured, nitrate-free
Beef, lean cuts
Beef jerky, nitrate-free
Bison
Buffalo
Chicken
Collagen protein powder
Cornish hens
Duck
Eggs
Fish, wild-caught, especially salmon, trout, and tuna
Game such as venison
Legumes
Nitrate/nitrite free deli meats
Ostrich
Pork, lean cuts
Protein powder, limited ingredient, low sugar, low carbohydrate
Shellfish
Tofu
Turkey
Turkey bacon
Dairy Proteins
Unless you’re lactose intolerant or can’t digest dairy products, the
Galveston Diet encourages some dairy. One of the main reasons is that the

decline in estrogen levels during menopause can increase a woman’s risk of
fractures, and dairy foods are high in bone-building calcium.
The strength of your bones depends very much on adequate amounts of
not only calcium but also vitamin D, also available from dairy protein.
Without these nutrients, your bones can slowly dissolve, becoming weak
and prone to breaking. Thus, prevention is essential.
In one study that involved nearly 750 postmenopausal women, those who
ate more dairy and animal protein had significantly higher bone density
than those who ate less of the dairy and animal protein.
Dairy foods may also help you sleep better. A study reported that foods
high in the amino acid glycine—widespread in milk and cheese, for
example—promoted deeper sleep in perimenopausal and postmenopausal
women.
Some dairy foods, especially yogurt, contain probiotics, which are
beneficial bacteria. The probiotics can help boost the population of
beneficial bacteria within the vagina and thus help prevent vaginal
infections. They also reduce the symptoms of vaginal infections, such as
vaginal discharge and odor, and are thus helpful for the treatment of
infections.

Hot Flash: 10 Surprising Benefits of Probiotics

When you think about probiotics like yogurt, gut health probably
comes to mind. It’s true that they help prevent and treat digestive
conditions such as diarrhea, constipation, and inflammatory bowel
diseases; and overall, they keep your gut microbiome—the trillions
of bacteria in your gut—balanced and healthy. But although the
many benefits of probiotics start in your gut, they don’t end there.
Probiotics also:
1. Help you lose weight and belly fat.
2. Improve some mental health conditions, such as depression,
anxiety, and memory loss.
3. Keep your heart healthy.
4. Improve cholesterol levels and triglycerides.
5. Boost your immune system.
6. Maintain urogenital health.
7. Help your body manage blood sugar.
8. Strengthen bones and joints.
9. Protect against liver disease.
10. Help improve cancer outcomes.
There are lots of positives about dairy! Here’s a list of foods you can
include.
Galveston Diet—Approved Dairy Proteins
Cheddar
Cottage cheese, full-fat
Cream cheese
Feta cheese
Goat cheese
Greek yogurt, full-fat
Havarti
Heavy cream
Kefir, full fat
Monterey Jack
Mozzarella and other softer cheeses
Parmesan and other hard cheeses

Sour cream
Swiss
Carbohydrates
I want you to enjoy carbs—the good ones. Those are mainly the non-
starchy carbs such as vegetables and some fruits, and the starchier carbs like
sweet potatoes, fruits, and certain whole grains. All these foods are packed
with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.
Stocking your fridge with leafy greens is important, too. Greens like
spinach, kale, collard greens, and chard are loaded with antioxidants and
can help prevent inflammation. Leafy greens can also help with hormones,
especially estrogen metabolism. Additionally, they are high in fiber.
Broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and Brussels sprouts are all part of
the cruciferous vegetable family. Like leafy greens, these vegetables help
process and remove excess estrogen from the body. One study revealed that
eating broccoli lowered levels of a type of estrogen linked to breast cancer,
while boosting an estrogen that protects against this disease.
Many of these high-quality carbs contain natural phytoestrogens. These
are compounds in foods that act as weak estrogens in the body. Although
there has been some controversy about including these in a diet, the most
recent studies report they have health benefits for women in menopause.
Foods that naturally contain phytoestrogens include soybeans, chickpeas,
peanuts, flax seeds, berries, and green and black teas, among others.
Fruits are a natural way to calm a sweet tooth, and they are full of
inflammation-fighting antioxidants. They are also high in water and fiber
content, both of which fill you up without filling you out.

Hot Flash: My Favorite Foods to Battle Hot Flashes
Up to 85 percent of menopausal women report hot flashes. These
hot flashes can also occur in as many as 55 percent of women who
are perimenopausal, and their incidence and severity can increase
as the woman gets closer to menopause.
If you’re experiencing hot flashes, you might find this statistic
discouraging, but don’t despair! Nutrition plays a huge role in

combating hot flashes. Indeed, eating the Galveston Diet way can
reduce them significantly. Here’s a list of nutrients and foods that
will put a lid on those overheating episodes.
Omega-3 fatty acids. Foods rich in these fats, such as salmon,
tuna, walnuts, and flax seeds, can decrease the severity and
frequency of hot flashes.
Vitamin E. Foods high in vitamin E, such as leafy greens,
pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds, and red bell pepper, can
help reduce hot flashes. Vitamin E is also a powerful antioxidant
and is thought to help repair damaged cells in our bodies.
Soy foods. Soy-rich foods such as tofu and edamame may help
alleviate hot flashes because they contain phytoestrogens. As a
bonus, soy foods contain protein, fiber, and healthy fats.
Fruits and veggies. We know through research that women who
consistently eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and who avoid
sugar and processed foods have very few menopausal symptoms,
such as hot flashes, weight gain, and the accumulation of visceral
fat.
Fiber Up!
I’ve always been a major advocate for eating more fiber. From my work as
a physician, I’ve known that people who consume the most fiber are the
healthiest. Fortunately, you can increase your fiber intake easily on the
Galveston Diet; over time, your efforts will pay off and you’ll feel the
benefits. That’s because fiber does the following.
Controls appetite. Fiber helps slow down the delivery of nutrients to the
gut and thus leaves you feeling full for longer, thereby suppressing your
appetite. With less appetite, you may lose weight without even having to
think about it. Fiber can also help reduce levels of the hunger hormone
ghrelin.
Trims your waistline. If you’ve been doing a lot of crunches lately, but
you’re starting to lose faith that the bulge at your waist will ever shrink, you
need to up your fiber intake, especially the soluble type. Some evidence
indicates that the weight-loss effects of this fiber specifically target belly
fat.

Fiber in general can help you shed pounds in other ways, too. For
instance, it takes a long time to chew most high-fiber foods. This slows
down the process of eating, allowing the satiety signals to reach your brain
before you’ve overeaten. Fiber may also reduce the amount of calories your
body absorbs from other foods you eat.
Regulates blood sugar and insulin. A well-demonstrated benefit of
fiber is its effect on blood-sugar levels and insulin requirements. Lots of
research with healthy subjects and people with diabetes have shown that
when fiber is eaten along with carbohydrates, the blood levels of
carbohydrates and insulin don’t rise as high as when carbs are eaten without
fiber.
Reduces breast cancer risk. A statistical review of studies on the
subject found that women who followed fiber-rich diets could reduce their
risk of breast cancer by 12 percent. How exactly does fiber pull this off?
Fiber does the following:
Decreases the level of excess estrogen in the blood circulation.
Combines with harmful and carcinogenic substances in the gut and,
like a broom, sweeps through your digestive system and ushers them
out of your body.
Promotes the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut and inhibits the
growth of bad bacteria—a process that interferes with the production
of carcinogens and promotes their decomposition in the gut.
Improves the ingestion of bad bacteria by macrophages, the white
blood cells that make up part of your immune system.
Promotes short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help fend off the
growth of tumor cells.
You should eat at least 25 grams of fiber a day—more if you can. This
isn’t as tough as it seems if you eat a lot of veggies and some fruit each day.

Increase Intake of Magnesium
One mineral you get a lot of on the Galveston Diet is magnesium. This
important but underappreciated mineral is key to women’s health. It is
involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions throughout the body and is
critical to energy stores and muscle and nerve function. It is estimated that
50 percent of women don’t get enough of it in their diet. What’s more, as
you get older and experience menopause, magnesium becomes particularly
important for good health; it may even help reduce menopause symptoms
and conditions. Magnesium does the following.
Keeps bones strong. Approximately 60 percent of a person’s magnesium
is stored in the bones, so it plays a big role in preventing osteoporosis
(along with calcium). With the declining levels of estrogen during
menopause, the bones start breaking down at a faster rate than they are
rebuilt, leading to weakened, porous bones. Magnesium helps prevent this
breakdown because it helps increase the calcification of the bone matrix.
What’s more, magnesium helps decrease inflammation, which weakens
bones over time.
Prevents insulin resistance and diabetes. Low amounts of magnesium
can make you vulnerable to these conditions, which you don’t want because
they can bring on many other complications.
Researchers have known for a long time that diabetes is linked to a
magnesium deficiency. That is, people with diabetes are thought to have a
peculiar defect in the metabolism of magnesium. Fortunately, including
fairly low doses of magnesium in your diet can help prevent diabetic
complications and can intervene in the course of the disease itself.
Guards heart health. Magnesium seems to protect the heart in several
different ways: it prevents abnormal heart rhythms, deters the formation of
blood clots, and regulates blood pressure.
One reason it is so favorable for the heart is that magnesium-rich foods
are a significant source of antioxidants, healthy fats, protein, and fiber, all
of which benefit heart health. In one study of nearly 4,000 postmenopausal
women, high magnesium levels were associated with lower inflammatory
markers related to heart disease, indicating better heart health.
Enhances sleep. Up to 60 percent of menopausal women experience
insomnia or have difficulty sleeping. Those who do nod off may have poor
sleep quality. Magnesium can help here, too, because it appears to promote

sleep by regulating the body’s circadian rhythms (known as the body’s
natural clock) and increasing muscle relaxation.
One small study of 46 older adults found that supplementing with 500
mg of magnesium daily led to a significant increase in sleep duration, sleep
quality, and the production of melatonin (a sleep hormone), while no
improvements were seen in the control group.
Lifts your mood. If you’re suffering from depression and don’t want to
take antidepressants, reach for some magnesium. The reason magnesium
may chase away the blues is its positive impact on brain function, mood
regulation, and stress response—all of which may affect the progression
and onset of depression.
Boosts fat burn. We don’t commonly think of magnesium as being a fat
burner, but it does help with weight loss. Emerging research has found that
it reduces insulin resistance. This is a condition in which you have too
much insulin and it doesn’t do its job properly; the result is that your body
can’t burn fat as efficiently, including stubborn belly fat. Insulin resistance
can also increase cravings for carbohydrate-rich snacks. So, magnesium
may be helpful for regulating blood sugar and insulin levels in people who
are overweight or obese. Magnesium also helps resolve bloating and water
retention.
Goes beyond menopause. Magnesium helps prevent and treat many
diseases, especially those associated with a short supply of it. This includes
Alzheimer’s disease, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, high blood
pressure, cardiovascular disease, and migraines.
Women need 310 to 320 mg of magnesium daily. See the following chart
for sources of magnesium.

Boost Your Omega-3 Fatty Acids
The benefits of omega-3 fats in menopause are considerable, which is why
I’ve talked a great deal about them in this book. They are plentiful in the
Galveston Diet because these fats do the following.
Reverse that middle-age spread. As mentioned earlier, EPA and DHA
are the omega-3 fatty acids found primarily in fatty fish. Both can actually
reduce body fat, particularly in the belly. Researchers in China did a
statistical analysis of seven studies involving omega-3 fats and overweight
adults, and they concluded that supplementation with omega-3s produced a
significant reduction in waist circumference.
Curb hunger. In a study of 232 overweight and obese volunteers,
researchers put the subjects (who were in the last two weeks of an eight-
week weight-loss plan) on either high or low doses of omega-3s. Those

taking the high doses reported feeling fuller and less hungry two hours after
their meal than did those who took the lower doses of omega-3s.
Reduce triglycerides. As you enter midlife, your triglyceride levels may
soar. And as those triglyceride levels rise, unfortunately the levels of good-
type HDL cholesterol fall, dramatically increasing your risk of heart
disease.
Postmenopausal women may have higher triglyceride concentrations than
premenopausal women, exposing them to increased risk of heart disease.
Omega-3 fatty acids are a must here. They help lower triglycerides, in
conjunction with a diet very low in sugar and refined carbs.
Ease menopause-related joint pain. Omega-3 fats help discourage the
formation of hormone-like agents called prostaglandins. These agents can
trigger inflammation that can harm your joints. Omega-3 fats come to the
rescue here. They powerfully fight inflammation, and in the process they
help relieve joint pain and stiffness in menopause. In fact, these fats work in
a similar way as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Help with the blues. Women are twice as likely to suffer from
depression as men, and the risk is even greater following menopause.
Irritability and sadness are common emotional symptoms of menopause,
but omega-3 fats may ease these symptoms by restoring structural integrity
to the brain cells that are critical in performing cognitive functions.
Support bone health. Eating more omega-3 acids has been found to
boost bone mineral content and help prevent osteoporosis. So, make these
fats an essential part of your diet.
Get your sexual mojo back. Omega-3 fats help lubricate your body in
general, therefore helping with dryness of the vagina—a common symptom
of perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause.
Most women need at least 2 grams of omega-3 fats daily. See the
following chart for sources and serving sizes.

Ease Your Menopause Issues with Vitamin D
I can’t say enough good things about vitamin D. Technically a hormone
rather than a vitamin, vitamin D shines for its health benefits, particularly in
the proper functioning of your heart, lungs, blood vessels, and immune
system. As for menopause issues, vitamin D can help in the following ways.
Supports weight loss. As a fat burner, vitamin D works in three key
ways. First, when your vitamin D levels are good, your body manufactures
more leptin, the hormone that tells your brain that you’re full and to stop
eating. Second, with an ample supply of this vitamin, your fat cells resist
making and storing fat. Third, vitamin D interacts with calcium to halt the

overproduction of cortisol, the notorious stress hormone that, when
chronically elevated, triggers the storage of belly fat.
Boosts muscle strength. The case for getting enough vitamin D is so
persuasive that it goes right down to your muscle strength and mass, which
decline with age. A recent study documented that this vitamin can
significantly increase muscle strength and reduce the loss of body muscle
mass in women as late as 12 or more years after menopause.
In this clinical trial, 160 Brazilian postmenopausal women were
randomized into two groups: a group receiving 1,000 units of vitamin D
daily and a placebo group. The researchers found at the end of the 9-month
study that the women who received the vitamin supplements showed an
increase of more than 25 percent in muscle strength. Those in the control
group lost an average of 6.8 percent of muscle mass. The women in that
group were also nearly twice as likely to fall.
Helps with depression. Research has shown that vitamin D might play
an important role in regulating mood and decreasing the risk of depression.
Published in Depression and Anxiety in 2020, a review of 7,534 people
found that those experiencing negative emotions who received vitamin D
supplements noticed an improvement in symptoms. The study also
concluded that vitamin D supplementation may help people with depression
who also have a vitamin D deficiency.
Resolves fatigue. Fatigue is a common menopause complaint, especially
in the early stages of menopause as the body adjusts to its fluctuating
hormones. One study from 2015 involving female nurses found a strong
connection between low vitamin D levels and self-reported fatigue. What’s
more, 89 percent of the participants were deficient in this vitamin.
Reboots your bones. Poor bone mineral density is a sign that your bones
are weakening owing to the loss of calcium and other minerals. This
condition places older adults, especially women, at a higher risk of
fractures. Regularly getting sufficient vitamin D and calcium at the same
time helps your body maximize absorption of calcium, leading to stronger
bones.
Cuts breast cancer risk. It has been demonstrated that treating breast
cancer cells with vitamin D stops the growth and spread of breast cancer
cells and initiates a process that encourages the death of those cells.
Women ages 19 to 50 should get 600 international units (IUs) of vitamin
D daily as a minimum for maintenance; women over 50 should get 800 IUs.

Although it’s possible to do this with a diet rich in vitamin D, it is also a
good idea to take a supplement. This will ensure that you’re getting the
appropriate amount each day.
The following chart lists the foods that are good sources of vitamin D.

Drink Up!
I recommend you get at least 64 ounces (8 cups) of water a day. Water is a
vital nutrient, but it’s also one of our most neglected ones. Water just has so
many benefits, ranging from heart health to brain function, to the
elimination of toxins from the body. For women, it helps prevent dryness
symptoms (like vaginal and skin dryness, common with menopause), and
bloating (which can come with hormonal changes). Overall, water
lubricates our bodies.

Here’s the red flag: avoid store-bought flavored waters; they are almost
always loaded with sugar and artificial additives. If plain water doesn’t
appeal to you, infuse your own with fruits, herbs, or veggies like sliced
cucumbers. It’s quick and easy to do and is a great way to use these foods.
Sugar Alternatives
Stevia and erythritol (with or without monk fruit) are the only acceptable
sugar alternatives known to not cause a spike in your insulin or glucose.
Many women ask me if these sugar alternatives can be used during the
fasting period. Personally, I do not consume anything sweet while fasting,
but the jury is still out on whether it affects fasting or not. Some scientists
believe that when the sweet receptors of the digestive tract are stimulated
by these substances, insulin is released, negating some of the benefits of
fasting.
Swerve sweetener is a popular brand of erythritol blend, available in both
confectioners’ and granular form.
The Joy of Change
The Galveston Diet has proved to be an extremely effective
program for resolving the symptoms and illnesses associated with
midlife. Recently, I was moved by the healing stories of two
participants, Bonnie and Donna, both of whom had a cluster of
health problems.
Bonnie, who began the program in 2019, had a fatty liver,
diabetes, abnormal cholesterol, and atrial fibrillation (also referred
to as a-fib, which is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm,
or arrhythmia, that can lead to blood clots in the heart). What
happened after she was well into the program was near miraculous.
“I had a health transformation. I no longer have a fatty liver. My
cholesterol levels are within the normal ranges. I’m no longer
diabetic. I haven’t had an a-fib episode in a year. I’ve lost 42
pounds since starting the program.”
Her cardiologist added, “Taking control of [her] health and diet
has directly affected [her] heart health.” Her primary care

physician weighed in, too: “With [her] diet change, [she] has
dodged some bullets.”
Donna, age 73, was taking eight medications for various
conditions, including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and
high cholesterol. After starting the Galveston Diet in February
2020, she reported: “Although weight loss was not my initial
concern, I lost a total of 24 pounds and many inches. But what I’m
most proud of is that my A1c [an indicator of diabetes] dropped
from 7.2 to a more normal 5.9. My blood pressure is within a
normal range, and my total cholesterol is 135. I’m now taking only
two medications.”
These stories are the norm for program participants, not the
exception. So, eat certain foods according to the diet, not just
because they will help you lose pounds and inches but also because
they are both healthful and healing—and will produce life-
transforming results for you.
As I’ve said repeatedly, what you eat every day on the Galveston Diet
has a profound and everlasting impact on your health, weight, and
longevity. Foods are concoctions of some awesome nutrients that, when
consumed, enter your cells, improving their activity and function. What you
give your cells through your food choices can make your body so strong
that you can boost your prospects for living an amazingly long and healthy
life.




CHAPTER 8
Putting It All Together:
The Meal Plans and Shopping Lists
Welcome to the Galveston Diet meal plans! To get started on this new way
of eating, I provide here four weeks of conventional menus and two weeks
of vegetarian menus—with no calculations required. All these meals have
ample portions of healthy fats, lean protein, and good carbohydrates, in the
proper ratios. These meals also contribute fiber, magnesium, omega-3 fatty
acids, vitamin D, and other important nutrients that support midlife health.
Each meal is proportioned just right to satisfy your hunger and help you feel
full afterwards. The recipes for these meal plans are included in Chapter 9.
As you see in the pages that follow, the daily plans include two meals and
two snacks a day (to be eaten within your eating window). Each daily plan
is followed by a macronutrient ratio analysis so you can see the balance and
track how you’ll get close to the recommended 70/20/10 proportion each
day. Remember, you won’t be counting calories on this program; focus on
macronutrient ratios instead.
Every week of plans is followed with a shopping list so you can plan
your week’s meals and buy the foods you’ll need. The lists are based on
using the meal plans as written, but you can, of course, adapt them to your
needs, to other recipes you want to include, and to how many people you’ll
be cooking for.
Having a detailed shopping list is essential for sticking to the week’s
meal plan, especially in these early weeks when you are getting used to this
new eating style. Knowing what to eat, how much to eat, and when to eat,
and having the ingredients readily available to prepare the meals as
designed, is one of the most important aspects of this program.
The key to good meal prep is to have a few basic foods that you can
prepare and cook ahead, divide into batches, and then use in many different

ways during the week. Take that extra time to prepare for the week ahead,
and you’ll be rewarded with the following:
Better nutrition. Following meal plans means you have control of the
nutrition, ingredients, and portions that you eat during the week. This
saves time and eliminates many decisions that might otherwise
jeopardize your waistline.
Better metabolism. You’ll be prepared at snack time when that hunger
strikes because you’ll have something nourishing and nutritious—
snacks that will fill you up, lower any inflammation, and help burn fat.
Wiser purchasing. Planning and prepping your meals will save you
money. Skip the $15 each weekday you spend on a takeout salad
covered in croutons and drenched with some unknown dressing (often
with preservatives and chemicals), and you’ll save $75. Use that
money to splurge on a massage or facial instead.
To best make use of the meal plans, try following some of these meal
prep suggestions:
1. Plan ahead. Decide what meals you’ll focus on for the week and how
many meals you’ll need to prepare. Keep a running inventory of what’s
in your fridge, freezer, and pantry, and note the basic items you are
running low on.
2. Make up your shopping list before you go to the grocery store. It’s
preferable to bring your market list to the store, so you know exactly
what you need to purchase. Once you get there, stick to the outer aisles as
much as possible, as that’s where you’ll find the fresh food, fruit, and
vegetables. Stock up on pantry basics, too, such as olive oils in different
flavors, a variety of nuts and seeds, and various spices and condiments.
And don’t forget about your local farmers’ market; it is a great source of
very fresh fruits and vegetables in season. But if you’re short on time,
most markets have a “click list” or online shop, where you can purchase
your items at home and then you can just pick up the packages or have
them delivered. This way you avoid the checkout line.
3. Read over the recipes for the week. If your cooking skills are minimal,
start with the easier recipes or those similar to what you’ve prepared
before and are confident about making. You can then ease into other, less

familiar preparations, learning as you go and exploring new taste
combinations. If you’re not familiar with using an outdoor grill, opt for a
grill pan on the stove or another cooking method before you attempt to
grill meat or vegetables outside.
4. Ensure your meals have variety. If you’ve planned the protein
foundation for your meal, sometimes introduce different vegetables,
fruits, and healthy fats to ensure you’re getting a variety of
micronutrients. Go for colorful foods, and “eat the rainbow.”
5. Have food storage containers handy. Glass is always best for taking
food from the fridge to the microwave, but plastic containers may be
more practical for packing lunch boxes. Consider packaging for your
snacks as well. Zipper-topped plastic bags are great for small items such
as nuts and seeds.
6. Use efficiency without sacrificing quality. In your food purchases,
stock up on frozen vegetables when they are on sale, consider spending a
few cents more for pre-cut vegetables to save prep time, and purchase
already trimmed or pre-cooked lean proteins for greater convenience. But
always read the labels or ask what ingredients were used in the
preparation or any prepared foods.
7. Lighten the mood. When you’re prepping or cooking your meals,
perhaps listen to your favorite podcast, audio book, or soundtrack—or
save your guilty pleasure TV show to watch while you’re in the kitchen.
Meals are not always on-the-spot cooking; they can be prepped and
cooked in a variety of ways. Explore these two styles of meal prep:
Make-ahead meals. These are full meals cooked hours in advance, then
refrigerated and reheated at mealtime. This is a helpful method for
handling dinner meals, especially when feeding a family.
Batch cooking. Make a large batch of a recipe and then split it into
individual portions and freeze them for future use. For example, if
you’re making a pot of chili, portion out a serving or two and place it
in the fridge, then portion the rest into individual servings, place in
storage containers, label with the date, and freeze for future enjoyment.
Individual portions. Prepare a recipe and store it in grab-and-go small
portions that can be taken out of the refrigerator and quickly heated or
enjoyed cold. This is a great option for breakfast meals.

General Guidelines for Using the Shopping Lists
As you set out to shop for your first week of eating the Galveston Diet way,
you’ll want to do a general shopping for pantry and other staples that you
will use for the entire program. See the list that follows for the staples
you’ll use frequently when eating on the Galveston Diet. Then, follow the
weekly shopping lists for the fresh foods and other particulars you’ll need
each week.
The food quantities included in each week’s shopping list are closest to
the quantity you will need for that week’s recipes. When possible, I’ve
rounded off the amount to a market size, but I often give the actual quantity
needed so that you can be assured you have the right amount.
Also, the quantities listed are for making the yields as noted in the
recipes. The assumption is that you are cooking mostly for yourself, and the
higher yields indicate that you’ll be eating that recipe more than once
during the week. But if you are cooking for others as well, you will need to
increase your grocery purchases (and/or repeat making the dish) to
correspond with the larger number of portions you need. Carefully check
the recipe yields and build your shopping list around those meals.
Remember, the shopping lists are a general guideline for what you’ll need
during the week; you may have on hand ingredients from a previous week,
or you may decide not to make a particular recipe.

If You Want to DIY Your Meals
Don’t want to follow the meal plans exactly? No problem; it’s easy to create
your own menus. The following are some examples.
Meal 1
Lunch salad. For meal 1, normally right around noon, it’s a good idea to
have a big mixed green salad with a quality protein like salmon, chicken, or
eggs. If you’re a vegan or vegetarian, top that salad with garbanzo beans or
another legume. Sprinkle some nuts or seeds on top, and scatter on some
avocado slices. Drizzle the salad with the juice of a lemon or some vinegar
mixed with olive oil or avocado oil and herbs. A salad is such an easy
vehicle for supplying your 70 percent of healthy fats like olive oil, avocado,
nuts, and seeds at lunch.
Lettuce wrap. Prepare a lettuce wrap filled with tuna or egg salad, or
hummus and veggies. A tomato stuffed with these foods is great, too. Meal
1 can even be a brunch with scrambled eggs, uncured, nitrate-free bacon,
and sauteed veggies. Your main goal is proper fuel and a balance of it,
including plenty of healthy fat!
For your beverage, at meals and snacks, have some more water, herbal
tea, or coffee. (Watch caffeine, though, because it can worsen hot flashes.)
Meal 2
Protein + veg + starch. Pick a protein, a non-starchy vegetable, and maybe
even a starchy vegetable like a sweet potato for a rounded meal. Good non-
starchy vegetables are asparagus, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower,
and cauliflower rice. For starchy vegetables, choose sweet potatoes, winter
squash, and potatoes.
Stir-fry + salad + potato. Try a stir-fry made with chicken tenders and
vegetables served over cauliflower rice. To add more fat to the mix, cook
the stir-fry in a high-quality fat like avocado oil. To keep it really simple,
use 4 ounces of a lean steak (or other protein choice), a side salad with

vinaigrette dressing, and a small baked potato topped with butter and sour
cream.
Vegetarian meal. If you’re looking for a vegetarian option, sauté some
zucchini noodles with pesto or just olive oil and herbs, and top with grated
Parmesan cheese.
In Summary
The meals all rely on proteins, veggies, salads, and fats in combination to
provide just the right balance of nutrients that will control your hormones
and metabolism.
Remember, you can enjoy two snacks a day in this program. Choose
snacks that are whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible. In addition to
nuts, consider cheese sticks, yogurt, olives, dill pickles, raw veggies, hard-
boiled eggs, fresh berries, or uncured beef jerky to keep any hunger in
check between meals.
You’ve probably noticed that all these meals are constructed of lots of
healthy fats, a moderate amount of quality protein, generous servings of
non-starchy carbs, and some starchy carbs. As I have explained, these foods
play a crucial role in supporting weight loss, keeping inflammation at a low
level, improving metabolism, supporting hormonal function, and enhancing
overall health.
You may also have noticed that I didn’t say anything about calorie counts
or portion sizes. The Galveston Diet was designed so that you don’t have to
worry or obsess about those details. Because fats, proteins, and fiber-rich
carbs make up most of the meals, you’ll feel satisfied throughout the day
and won’t want to reach for that ol’ sugary stuff or refined carbohydrates.
And by the time you’re well into the program, you will intuitively know
which foods to select to build your meals and you will eat properly and feel
at your best. And don’t forget to track your macros; that will help you be
even more successful!




CHAPTER 9
The Galveston Diet Recipes
Since starting the Galveston Diet as an online program, I’ve been working
with coaches, nutritionists, and chefs to develop more delicious, can’t-wait-
to-eat-this-again recipes that will keep you happy and on track. I love to
cook and experiment with flavors and foods at home, so I’ve contributed
some recipes as well.
In creating these recipes, we focused not only on flavor but also on ease
of preparation. Let’s face it—we’re all busy. We need recipes that not only
taste delicious but also can be made quickly.
These recipes are brand-new and not available online. They have been
designed for the conventional Galveston Diet—which includes animal
foods—but also for the vegan/vegetarian program, if you’re someone who
prefers to avoid animal products.
Enjoy!

Continue to roll out and cook the tortillas; while one tortilla is cooking,
roll out the next. As the tortillas are finished cooking, stack them on a
plate with pieces of parchment or wax paper between them. You’ll need
8 tortillas for this recipe; you can freeze any remaining ones for future
use.
6. Make the filling: Heat the avocado oil in a medium saucepan over
medium heat, then add the onion and bell pepper. Sauté until the onion
and pepper are softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the zucchini and then
add the eggs. Blend in the spinach, stir to combine, then when the
spinach has wilted, add the chili powder, garlic salt, onion powder, and
cumin. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring, until the filling is blended
and heated through.
7. Assemble the enchiladas: On a work surface, place one tortilla and then
spoon on about ½ cup of the filling. Sprinkle on 1 ½ tablespoons of the
cheese, then roll up the tortilla, keeping the filling in place. Put the
enchilada in a 13 by 9-inch baking dish and then continue to fill and roll
the remaining 7 enchiladas.
8. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Pour the sauce over the enchiladas in the
baking dish and sprinkle any remaining cheese on top. Bake for
approximately 30 minutes, or until heated through, the sauce is bubbly,
and the cheese is starting to brown on top. Serve while still hot.

CHAPTER 10
The Galveston Diet for Life
Perhaps in the past you’ve been on a diet or nutritional plan, and you get to
a point at which you want to just maintain your weight—or not gain back
any you’ve lost. Not many plans offer a concrete way to do this, but the
Galveston Diet does. The way it’s done is to focus not only on just
maintaining that weight loss but also on maintaining your new lifestyle.
There’s a difference. People who are the most successful at permanent
weight loss are those who stick with the positive eating habits and lifestyle
behaviors that have helped them reach their goals.
You’ve now lived the Galveston Diet for about a month. You’ve gotten
the hang of the intermittent fasting and have incorporated into your
shopping and cooking routines the idea of pairing anti-inflammatory
nutrition with macronutrients in the right ratios, and of obtaining optimal
micronutrients to avoid nutritional deficiencies. All three actions, especially
when turned into positive habits, will help you stay successful from here on
out.
Think of your new habits like paths through the woods. You form trails
by walking them over and over, until there is a well-worn path. Whenever
you go for a walk in the woods, you’ll then follow this easy, beautiful path
instead of crashing your way through shrubs and brambles to get to your
destination. The well-worn path feels good, too, and you’ll want to walk it
again and again. And so it is with your new, well-worn eating and lifestyle
habits.
The Galveston Diet has been about restoring your health and wellness in
an important phase of your life, one that will encompass 40 percent or more
of that life! You’ve restored your body to a healthy weight and likely have
healed a lot of health conditions. Naturally, you’ll want to stay on that path!
So, the question is: How do you continue to live this lifestyle? The
answer is to move into what I call “maintenance mode”: you work these

habits more and more firmly into your routine as you go along. You can,
however, now make a few modifications to those routines—flexibility
becomes the name of the game, once you have the core actions in place.
Continue Intermittent Fasting
By now, your body is used to intermittent fasting, so it should be an easy
habit to maintain for a lifetime. I originally thought I’d do it only for a few
months. But what started as an experiment actually turned into a way of life
for me that’s helped me take control of my weight, lower my inflammation,
and feel amazing every day.
Although intermittent fasting is a modest way to shed pounds, its real
power comes in keeping those pounds off. No more weight regain or yo-yo
dieting. And I now make intermittent fasting part of my standard weight-
loss maintenance advice to the women I counsel.
The bottom line is that for the first time we have a tool—a habit—that
works for keeping weight off and inflammation levels low.
Science backs me up. In the past, when people lost weight they were
generally advised to monitor and count calories so as to keep that weight
off. But statistics tell us this method doesn’t work: 95 percent of dieters
regain their lost weight within a year, often with interest. And worse, 50
percent of the weight they lost was from fat and the other 50 percent was
muscle mass.
In 2021, a group of researchers from the University of Kansas Medical
Center conducted an interesting study involving intermittent fasting for
weight-loss maintenance. They found that intermittent fasting was an
effective alternative to counting calories as a way to prevent weight regain,
and that it may just be a superior tool for helping people stay at a healthy
weight.
Keep it up!
Eat Smarter and Live Better with Anti-Inflammatory Foods
By now, you realize that the food you eat plays a critical role in keeping
inflammation at a low level, in improving your metabolism, in supporting
weight loss, and in enhancing your health.
Because the Galveston Diet is really a pattern of eating versus a crash
diet, it is among the most effective inflammation-fighting plans around. The

key components from here on out are to eat a variety of foods (especially
plants) that are high in antioxidants, phytochemicals, fiber, and healthy fats,
as well as lean proteins and other nutrients. These foods and nutrients are
the key proactive steps you can take to prevent disease, control your weight,
and keep midlife symptoms from returning.
You now have even more flexibility in your food selections. On the
maintenance program, you can expand your choices of anti-inflammatory
foods. Now, for example, you can add more fruits, such as grapes, melons,
papaya, pineapple, peaches, and virtually any other fresh fruit to your
repertoire in increments of one or two servings a day.
You can also increase your intake of carbohydrates with an extra serving
or two of starchy carbs such as sweet potatoes, winter squash, various root
vegetables, and whole grains. All these foods have enormous anti-
inflammatory power. Just be sure to track your carb macros to make sure
they match your maintenance allowance (see page 229).
Remember, the Galveston Diet is a forever plan that’s all about choice—
your choice—to eat well and live well. And as I’ve pointed out, it has
nothing to do with willpower and everything to do with learning about your
body and reinforcing the behaviors for life that will create the healthiest
version of you.
Anti-inflammatory foods are a huge part of all this. They cut your risk of
long-term disease—so eat them every day! Inflammation, however, can
come back quickly if you revert to the wrong foods. So, you’ve got to fight
off inflammation for good with the right nutrition.
Change Up Your Fuel Ratios
As your waist-hip ratio, weight, and other markers of good health improve,
you can begin to change your macro ratios over the course of a few weeks.
What this means is that you can now eat more good carbs and less fat, while
sticking to a moderate amount of protein.
This involves readjusting your macros—in other words, you’ll make a
shift in the percentages of carbohydrate and fat. Once you’ve reached a
point at which you’re healthier, feel great, and like your size, you no longer
need to follow a macro formula that puts your body in a fat-burning mode.
You can stabilize everything with a macro adjustment.
Why is this the case? Because now, everything should be rocking. Your
hormones are better regulated, your metabolism is healthier, and you have

more energy. Your body can now handle a different percentage of macros.
You’ll still continue to choose anti-inflammatory foods that honor your
body—and more of them. You’ll still refocus your fuel but with different
macros, and you’ll do this gradually. “Gradual” is the name of the game
here. It moves the needle slowly, and as a result, it makes changes far more
likely to stick.
Here’s how to do this:
Start with one or more weeks at 60 percent fat, 20 percent protein, and
20 percent carbohydrates.
Progress to additional weeks at 50 percent fat, 20 percent protein, and
30 percent carbohydrate.
Stabilize over the long term at 40 percent fat, 20 percent protein, and
40 percent carbohydrates.
Of course, it’s important to continue to track your macronutrients as you
make these adjustments. Take your time and be sure to pay attention to how
your body feels with these adjustments—and be patient. Each new
adjustment may take a few weeks to become a habit.
Monitor your weight, too. On maintenance, go with weekly weigh-ins or
weigh a few times each week. People who have successfully kept weight
off and are a part of the National Weight Control Registry—the largest
study of people who have been successful at long-term weight loss—
maintain their weight by stepping on the scale about once a week.
Don’t forget to monitor your non-scale changes as well. Keep track of
your waist-to-hip ratio, as discussed earlier. As you continue adding more
foods back into your diet, it’s important to recognize if a reintroduced food
is causing any inflammation or discomfort. If so, consider reducing the
amount of that food or eliminating it from your diet.
Don’t be alarmed over a 5-pound weight gain; that’s usually normal. But
if you find weight creeping back higher than that, or if your waist-to-hip
ratio is not what it should be, an alarm bell should sound. That’s a signal to
rein yourself in by returning briefly to the 70 percent fat, 20 percent protein,
and 10 percent carbohydrate ratios.
As you adjust your ratios on maintenance, consider these tips:

All the recipes in this book can be modified in some way to better suit
the maintenance macros.
Replace lower-carb vegetables with whole grains, legumes, and
starchier squashes and fruits.
Reduce the amount of healthy fats enjoyed at each meal and snack
time. An example would be eating ½ avocado versus a whole or using
1 tablespoon olive oil versus 2 tablespoons.
Continue to select anti-inflammatory foods. Maintenance does not
mean returning to tons of processed/refined carbs! My personal rule of
thumb is that if a food is made in nature and doesn’t require a label, it’s
a thumbs-up! But if a food is made in a factory, does not look like a
naturally occurring food (grains don’t grow in the shape of a Cheerio,
for instance), or is a “food-like substance” with flavors created by a
scientist (like some chips), that’s a big thumbs-down.
When purchasing condiments, it’s essential to review the ingredients and
avoid added sugars and inflammatory ingredients whenever possible.
The Joy of Change
Amazing things happen when you do the Galveston Diet for life!
At age 43, Valerie had a complete hysterectomy. Although she
had never had a weight problem, she noticed her weight creeping
up over the years. By age 50, she had gained noticeable
menopausal weight, reaching 134 pounds on her very small frame,
especially around her middle.
“I had a belly pooch that I’ve never had in my life. I am curvy
and love that, but not “poochy.” Anyway, I lost 6 pounds in two
weeks! As of right now, I’m down to my goal weight of 120
pounds.
“Most of all, I no longer experience bloating, constipation and
have eliminated added sugar from my diet. Also, my pooch is
gone. I feel wonderful! All this [was] done with no pills,
gimmicks, or unrealistic eating that no person can maintain.”
Then there is Laurie, who was going through menopause. After
six weeks on the program, she lost 12 pounds, along with seeing

several other positive changes. “I’ve also noticed that my hips no
longer ache after driving or sitting for an extended period,” she
said. “This relief is amazing for me since this pain had become
increasingly worse and made me wonder if I might need a hip
replacement. I’m a very busy midwife in Michigan, and I plan to
work for quite a few more years, as long as I feel healthy. And I
feel so healthy after eating the way the program has taught me.”
After Mayra got her blood work back recently, she was elated.
“I’m no longer prediabetic or have borderline high cholesterol. As
I continue to do the program and exercise, I’ll drop the remaining
weight, but the best part is that I have no menopause symptoms at
all. They were mild before, but nothing now.”
And Debbie is an intermittent fasting “lifer.” “I followed the
eating plan and practiced the 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. I
lost 77 pounds and have never felt better. I wish I had known about
intermittent fasting earlier in my life because it has helped me keep
my weight off. In the past, I always yo-yoed in weight, but not
anymore.”

Maintenance Versions of Galveston Diet Recipes
Meal 1 and Meal 2 Recipes
Following are seven maintenance versions of recipes included earlier in The
Galveston Diet. All include small changes that reflect the shift in your ratios
for maintenance eating.
Meatloaf with Mashed Cauliflower and Baked Sweet
Potato
In this maintenance version of the meatloaf recipe on page 198, I
upped the carbs by swapping out almond flour for oat flour (which is
higher in carbohydrates). Serve a slice of this meatloaf with a small
baked sweet potato, and you’ve plated up a delicious meal of good carbs
with lots of anti-inflammatory benefits.
MAKES 6 SERVINGS
2 tablespoons olive oil
¼ cup chopped onion
1 ½ pounds lean, grass-fed ground beef

1 cup oat flour
2 large eggs
⅓ cup no-sugar-added tomato sauce
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
½ teaspoon garlic powder
6 small sweet potatoes
2 cups mashed cauliflower (from frozen or homemade)
6 tablespoons (¾ stick) salted butter
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet, add the onion, and sauté until it turns
translucent, about 3 minutes.
3. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, sautéed onion, oat flour, eggs,
tomato sauce, cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Shape the mixture
into a firm oval loaf.
4. Place the loaf in a shallow baking pan or loaf pan, and bake for 1 hour.
When the loaf has been baking for about 15 minutes, poke the sweet
potatoes with a fork and place on the oven rack alongside the pan or on
another rack of the oven.
5. Meanwhile, prepare the mashed cauliflower according to package
instructions.
6. Carefully remove the loaf from the pan, discarding the surrounding fat,
and transfer to a serving platter. Also, test the sweet potatoes and, if soft,
remove from the oven.
7. Slice the loaf for serving, place the slices on plates, and accompany with
portions of the mashed cauliflower and a sweet potato. If desired, top the
servings of cauliflower with generous pats of butter.
Mini-Avocado “For Life” Toast
Here’s an example of how you can modify a simple recipe to
supply a little less fat. To change the full recipe on page 175, I simply cut
back the olive oil and used half an avocado instead of a whole one.

MAKES 1 SERVING
½ teaspoon olive oil
2 large eggs
2 slices sprouted-grain bread (such as Food For Life brand)
½ avocado, pit removed, sliced
Salt and black pepper
Red pepper flakes (optional)
1. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet until shimmering.
Add the eggs and cook to your preferred style, either fried or scrambled,
about 3 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, toast the bread to desired doneness.
3. Place the toast on a serving plate. Add the avocado slices, then add the
eggs and season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the red
pepper flakes, if using. Serve at once.
Lemon-Caper Chicken with Farro
On maintenance, you can begin to enjoy more grains so as to
slightly increase your carbohydrates. This maintenance version of Lemon
Chicken with Capers (page 195) includes farro, a high-fiber, high-protein
whole-grain wheat that is yummy.
MAKES 4 SERVINGS
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (about 1 pound)
Salt and black pepper
4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or olive oil
2 lemons, 1 juiced and 1 sliced
1 garlic clove, sliced
2 tablespoons drained capers
1 large onion, sliced
4 cups trimmed green beans
¼ cup slivered almonds, toasted
4 cups cooked farro, warm
2 tablespoons salted butter

1. Pat the chicken pieces dry and season to taste with salt and pepper.
2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the ghee
and, when shimmering, add the chicken pieces. Cook, flipping once, for
8 to 10 minutes, until cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
Cover and keep warm.
3. To the skillet, add the lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of the ghee, the garlic,
and capers and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the lemon
slices, then return the chicken to the skillet and reduce the heat. Simmer
the chicken for 5 minutes.
4. In another medium skillet over medium heat, warm the remaining 2
tablespoons ghee. When shimmering, add the onion and beans, and cook
until the onion is translucent and the beans are fork-tender, about 5
minutes.
5. Toss the slivered almonds into the beans and stir to combine.
6. Arrange the chicken on a serving platter and accompany with the onion
and beans. Spoon the farro alongside and top with pats of butter.
Tofu in Peanut Sauce with Brown Rice
Here’s an Asian-inspired vegetarian dish but without all the
sugary sauce. This maintenance version of Tofu in Peanut Sauce (page
187) supplies extra carbs with the addition of brown rice, which is rich in
fiber and full of magnesium.
MAKES 4 SERVINGS
1 (14-ounce) square firm tofu
¼ cup no-added-sugar peanut butter
2 tablespoons tamari
2 tablespoons water
3 tablespoons Swerve sweetener
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 ¼ cups chopped fresh broccolini
1 tablespoon coconut oil

4 cups steamed brown rice, warm
1. Sandwich the tofu between 2 paper towels and 2 plates. Place a heavy
item like a can on the top plate, and press the tofu for at least 30 minutes.
The cut the tofu into ½-inch cubes; you should have about 1 ½ cups.
2. In a small bowl, combine the peanut butter, tamari, water, and sweetener.
Add the sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and ginger.
3. Steam or boil the broccolini until tender, about 5 minutes. Keep warm.
4. Heat the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat and when melted,
add the tofu and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, occasionally turning, until
lightly browned.
5. Stir in the sauce and blend well. Place the brown rice in serving bowls
and spoon the tofu mixture over. Serve with the broccolini on the side.
Vegan Protein Lower-Fat Salad
Here’s another example of how you can slightly reduce the fat in a
recipe—by cutting back on olive oil and tahini, and using half an
avocado rather than a whole. This is the maintenance version of Vegan
Protein Salad (page 181).
MAKES 2 SERVINGS
FOR THE TEMPEH
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
½ teaspoon garlic powder
Pinch of salt and black pepper
½ block tempeh (about 4 ounces), cut into cubes
FOR THE TOFU
½ block medium or firm tofu (about 5 ounces), cut into cubes
½ teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce
Pinch of salt and black pepper
FOR THE SALAD

1 cup chopped and steamed broccoli
2 cups lightly chopped fresh arugula
1 cup diced cucumber
1 avocado, pitted and chopped
4 tablespoons hemp seeds
2 teaspoons tahini
1 teaspoon olive oil
Fresh lemon juice
1. Make the tempeh: Mix the balsamic vinegar, tamari, maple syrup, garlic
powder, and salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Add the tempeh and let
soak for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.
2. When ready, preheat the oven to 400°F. Either spray a small baking dish
with nonstick cooking spray or line it with a silicone baking mat.
3. Transfer the tempeh cubes to the baking dish and bake the tempeh for 20
minutes. Toss the tempeh cubes with a with a bit of the leftover
marinade, if desired. Keep the oven turned on.
4. Make the tofu: Toss the tofu cubes with the garlic powder, tamari, and
salt and pepper and bake at 400°F for 30 minutes, until lightly browned.
(If desired, bake it at the same time as you bake the tempeh.)
5. Assemble the salad: Place the broccoli, arugula, cucumber, and avocado
in a large salad bowl. Add the tempeh and tofu cubes, and mix well.
Sprinkle on the hemp seeds. Drizzle on the tahini and olive oil, then toss
to coat everything well with the dressing. Finish the salad with a spritz of
fresh lemon juice and serve.
Vegetarian Oat Cakes with Almond Butter and
Blueberries
This delicious breakfast or brunch dish substitutes oat flour for
the ground flaxseed in the Flaxseed Pancakes (page 176). Oat flour is
slightly higher in carbs and is a great source of fiber, vitamins, and
minerals. In fact, try using oat flour rather than white flour to bump up
the good carbs in any of your recipes.
MAKES 4 SERVINGS

1 cup oat flour
4 large eggs, lightly beaten
⅓ cup unsweetened almond milk (or other milk), or more as needed
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
⅛ teaspoon salt
½ tablespoon coconut oil
4 tablespoons unsweetened almond butter
2 cups frozen blueberries
1. In a large bowl, combine the oat flour, eggs, almond milk, lemon juice,
baking soda, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. If the mixture is too thick, add
more almond milk or water to achieve a batter consistency.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the coconut oil. When
melted and hot, pour about ¼ cup of the batter for each oat cake and
gently spread it with a spoon. Let cook on one side for 2 to 3 minutes or
until the edges begin to firm and bubbles appear, then flip and cook on
the opposite side for another 2 to 3 minutes. Keep the cooked oat cakes
warm on a covered plate while you make any remaining cakes with the
remaining batter.
3. Meanwhile, melt the almond butter in a small bowl in the microwave.
Place the frozen blueberries in a medium bowl and microwave until they
are no longer frozen, have warmed slightly, and become juicy.
4. Place the oat cakes on serving plates, drizzle with the melted almond
butter, and sprinkle with the blueberries.
Slow Cooker Mushroom Stroganoff with Creamy
Brown Rice
In the recipe on page 200, the stroganoff is served with
cauliflower rice. Here, the stroganoff is accompanied with brown rice, a
terrific source of quality carbs and fiber. I’ve also increased the yogurt
and parsley and decreased the amount of fat.

MAKES 4 SERVINGS
FOR THE STROGANOFF
5 cups halved or quartered button mushrooms
6 garlic cloves, minced
1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
2 cups vegetable broth
4 teaspoons smoked paprika
2 tablespoons plain full-fat Greek yogurt
Salt and black pepper
½ cup chopped fresh parsley
FOR THE CREAMY RICE
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 cups cooked brown rice
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
½ cup vegetable broth
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or unsalted butter
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1. Make the stroganoff: Place the mushrooms, garlic, onion, broth, and
paprika in a slow cooker and set to cook on high for 4 hours.
2. Open the cooker and stir in the yogurt. Season to taste with the salt and
pepper. Cover the cooker and keep the stroganoff warm.
3. Make the creamy rice: Heat a large saucepan over medium heat and add
the olive oil. When hot, add the brown rice, garlic, salt, and pepper and
cook for 3 minutes, stirring gently with a wooden spoon. Pour in the
vegetable broth, cover, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for
12 minutes, stirring gently and occasionally.
4. Stir in the ghee and cream, and stir while simmering for another 5
minutes.
5. Serve the stroganoff with the creamy garlic brown rice.

SNACK RECIPES
Nutty Banana Toast
Bananas are one of the fruits you can enjoy on the Galveston
Diet. They are a great source of potassium and electrolytes, and are a
good way to increase your carbohydrate macro.
MAKES 1 SERVING
2 slices sprouted-grain bread (such as Food For Life)
1 tablespoon unsweetened almond butter
1 medium banana, sliced
Ground cinnamon (optional)
Toast the bread to desired doneness. Spread the toast with the almond
butter, then lay on the banana slices. If desired, sprinkle with the cinnamon,
then serve.
Date Night
Dates are a delicious source of natural sweetness. Plus, they are a
good source of potassium, magnesium, and iron. Dates also rate high on
indices that measure antioxidant activity. So, coupled with some dark
chocolate, the dates here will give you a big punch of antioxidants and
have welcome anti-inflammatory benefits.
MAKES 1 SERVING
1 (1-ounce) square 70% or darker chocolate
2 medjool dates, pitted
Place the chocolate in a small bowl and microwave on low until melted, 2
to 3 minutes. Dip or roll the dates in the melted chocolate.
Chickpea and Tomato Salad
When you prepare recipes with legumes like chickpeas, you’re
getting a lot of good carbs, protein, and fiber all in one dish. This snack
is easy to fix and packed with benefits.
MAKES 1 SERVING

1 cup canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 cup halved or quartered grape tomatoes
2 extra-large pitted black olives, sliced
1 tablespoon minced onion
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
In a medium bowl, combine the chickpeas, grape tomatoes, olives, and
onion. Drizzle on the vinegar and allow the mixture to sit for 10 to 15
minutes before eating.
Summer Fruit Salad
On maintenance, you get to eat more fresh fruit. One way to make
that happen is to prepare a fruit salad like this one, in which you get a
variety of colorful fruits, all rich in antioxidants.
MAKES 1 SERVING
1 medium banana, sliced
½ cup sliced fresh strawberries
½ cup cubed fresh watermelon
Combine the banana, strawberries, and watermelon in a medium bowl and
enjoy.
Cinnamon Baked Apple with Raisins
One easy way to up your carb intake is to combine fruits in a
recipe like this one. Here, an apple is paired with raisins, both high in
good carbs, plus with lots of fiber.
MAKES 1 SERVING
1 teaspoon salted butter
¼ cup raisins of choice
1 medium apple, cored
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
Place the butter and raisins in the cavity of the apple, then sprinkle with the
cinnamon. Place in a small bowl and microwave the apple on medium for 1

to 2 minutes, or until softened slightly.
Lemon-Ricotta Dip with Pear Slices
Pears are among the highest fiber fruits you can eat. Enjoy them
with this delicious dip.
MAKES 4 SERVINGS
1 cup whole-milk ricotta
1 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
4 pears, any variety, split, cored, and sliced
Place the ricotta, lemon juice, olive oil, and basil in a small bow. Mix well,
then serve with the pear slices.
Eating Out
The Galveston Diet is so versatile, with so many different foods, that you’re
not doomed to cook all your meals at home; it just means you’ll want to
make the right selections when you do dine out.
Increasingly, restaurants are serving foods that are healthy and fresh.
Many menus include lots of grilled meats and fish, fresh vegetables of all
types, and many other healthy ingredients. As a result, it’s not difficult to
eat out while you’re living the Galveston Diet lifestyle.
As a rule of thumb, just remember to select menu items based on the
general eating pattern of lean protein, vegetables (like a side salad and/or
low-carb veggies), and a healthy starch, such as a small sweet potato or a
small portion of brown rice.
For example, select your entree from lean meat (such as a small sirloin or
filet mignon), broiled or roasted chicken or turkey, or baked, grilled, or
poached fish. Then choose from the vegetable sides or salads with
vinaigrette dressing, and you’re all set.
Don’t be afraid to ask for substitutions or additions. Now, more than ever,
restaurants are happy to accommodate special requests, such as holding the
fries and doubling the vegetables. The foods that don’t align with your

goals will not go to waste, and they won’t be staring up at you, tempting
you!
As healthy as the dining options are becoming, the portions at most
restaurants are far larger than we’d dish up for ourselves at home. So,
remember, when you feel full, you don’t have to finish it all. Take the rest
home in a doggie bag for another meal.
Here are some specific tips for dining out that should be helpful when
living the Galveston Diet lifestyle.
Sandwich shops and burger restaurants. A lot of these establishments
will prepare burgers and other protein-filled sandwiches on giant lettuce
leaves rather than on buns—if you ask. This choice is a great way to shave
processed carbohydrates off your meal.
Bowls and salad entrees. I love to see these on the menu, especially
bowls that often replace burritos or tacos on Southwestern or Mexican
menus. You can ask for a bowl (or salad) made of protein, lettuce, legumes,
a little cheese, salsa, and guacamole, for example. Any salad can be a great
entree when piled with grilled chicken or shrimp, legumes, and sliced
avocado. Getting nuts into the mix can be challenging, but many restaurants
offer grilled meat or chicken that can be served with a side salad, rice, or a
small cup of black beans or charro beans. Some Mexican restaurants even
offer high-fiber tortillas that can be filled with meat or beans.
Asian restaurants. These offer a variety of meats, seafood, and veggies
for a stir-fry. The key here is to ask for the dish with a light sauce and with
a little bit of brown rice on the side. Black bean sauce might be a healthy
bet, for example. Other good menu choices include steamed or lightly stir-
fried vegetables; be sure to ask for extra veggies with any dish.
Also, moo shu vegetable or chicken or moo goo gai pan is usually loaded
with vegetables like cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, water chestnuts, bamboo
shoots, and sometimes cashews, and flavored with ginger and garlic. Try
having a broth-based Asian soup for starters. It will really fill you up.
Steakhouses. Traditional options like steak, grilled chicken or fish, side
salads, and fresh veggies are easy to order here. Just make sure that no
sugary glazes or sauces come with your dish. Or, see if your protein can be
topped with sautéed mushrooms. Many of these places also offer entree
salads that can be made Galveston Diet friendly.
Greek and Mediterranean restaurants. Opt for the delicious and
healthy items sure to be on these menus, like grilled meats and Greek

salads. For a vegetarian dish, order hummus with sliced cucumbers for
dipping (always a better choice than pita bread).
Italian. Italian food isn’t all about the pasta! Indeed, in Italy itself, many
regions don’t eat much of it at all. When you’re eating out at an Italian
restaurant, look at the secondi part of the menu—that’s where the non-pasta
entrees are usually hiding. Structure your meal around a lean protein like
steak, chicken, or fish. Avoid the bread and enjoy plenty of fresh vegetables
dressed with olive oil.
Indian. Tandoori chicken is always a sure bet here. Have some veggies
on the side or a small serving of curried chickpeas. This cuisine is typically
prepared with lots of anti-inflammatory spices, too.
Pizza. I’ve noticed lately that many pizza restaurants are catering to the
low-carb crowd by offering pizza made with cauliflower crusts. If you find
a place that offers a crust like this, pile it high with veggies like peppers,
onions, and mushrooms. Don’t forget some olives for a little extra fat.
Breakfast. If you’re eating breakfast out (on a break during your
morning fast), stick to eggs, a little side of fruit, and maybe some turkey
bacon. Veggie omelets are a great choice, too.
Other Lifestyle Guidelines
As the three actions described in The Galveston Diet become everyday
habits, you’ll want to be sure to make other smart and health-inducing
choices to your lifestyle. Getting enough sleep, getting some exercise, and
engaging in ongoing self-reflection will only help solidify the habits for
you.
Sleep Well and Stay Healthy—for Life
Scrimping on sleep may seem like a good way to squeeze in a few more
productive hours into your busy day, but you may pay a hefty price with
your health.
If you’ve noticed that you’re hungrier and crave unhealthy foods when
you don’t get enough sleep, chalk it up to hormones. Studies show that
when you sleep only four or five hours a night, the hunger hormone ghrelin
spikes—so you feel really hungry the next day.
Plus, when you’re sleep deprived, your body releases cortisol. When
cortisol goes up, it tells your liver to release its stored glucose. But it also

limits insulin. So, your blood sugar levels soar, making you crave foods,
usually sugary carbs. Still other research has linked sleep deprivation to
depression and anxiety, both prevalent in mid-life, as well as insulin
resistance, which is a trigger for high blood pressure, heart disease, and type
2 diabetes.
One of the best ways to improve your sleep is to develop a sleep ritual—
much like we did for our children when they were young. My daughters’
bedtime routine included a taking bath and reading a story together before
bedtime.
Do something similar for yourself now. A consistent nighttime ritual
signals your brain and body to begin slowing down for the night. Some
ideas for creating your own sleep ritual are as follows:
Use white noise or earplugs, or silence your cell phone to reduce
disruptions. Even better, place your cell phone in another room to
avoid temptation.
At night, reduce your exposure to bright and blue light (from
electronics) 45 to 60 minutes before bedtime.
Stick to a sleep schedule. Make a plan before your week gets busy.
Look over your schedule and put together a sleep schedule that you
can stick to. Go to bed and wake up at close to the same time each day.
According to most medical guidelines, the optimal amount of sleep for
most adults is seven to eight hours each night.
Become a napper. Take a short nap when you can. If you work shifts
and don’t get enough sleep, napping can help you stay awake when
you need to and avoid a sleep deficit. Even if you are a non-shift
worker, don’t deny yourself a 15- to 30-minute nap when you’re
weary. Any longer than that may interrupt your sleep schedule later
that night.
Avoid stimulants such as caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine at least six
hours prior to bedtime. All three substances have the potential to
impact the quality and length of your sleep.
Stay Active
If you started exercising or ramping up your workouts while embarking on
the Galveston Diet, you’ll want to maintain your exercise program,
especially to manage your weight and other midlife symptoms.

Exercise is just so important now. It alters your body composition,
increasing your lean muscle mass and shrinking your fat mass. Both
changes help you maintain your new healthy weight.
It also improves your bone mineral density (BMD) and thus prevents or
halts osteoporosis, the loss of bone mass that happens to be one of the
biggest concerns as women enter menopause. In fact, the number one
recommendation for preventing osteoporosis is regular exercise.
Those body aches and pains you’ve been dealing with? Exercise to the
rescue. Most pain symptoms at this point in your life are associated with
arthritis, hip pain, or lower back discomfort. It may seem counterintuitive,
but when you work those “tough spots,” the less they hurt in the long run.
I’ve talked in The Galveston Diet a lot about visceral fat and its dangers.
As much as the three actions of the diet target this particularly hard-to-lose
fat, regular exercise actually “moves” fat from your abdomen area and more
evenly distributes it throughout your body.
Along with an anti-inflammatory diet, exercise protects against obesity-
related diseases/complications, including type 2 diabetes, high blood
pressure, certain types of cancer, fatty liver, and more. Regular physical
activity also decreases your risk of developing breast cancer.
I love exercise, too, for how it makes me feel, mentally and emotionally.
It boosts my mood and relieves stress. I feel more confident and more
productive in my day-to-day life when I make and protect my commitment
to move my body. It will help you, too.
The attitude to take is that it is never too late to become more active. If
you’re feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of adding exercise to your
already busy lifestyle or if you’re feeling defeated by prior years of
inactivity, please don’t give up. Any amount of exercise—a daily 20-minute
walk, a half-hour yoga class, some strength training twice a week, a fun
sport—that you can add to your life at any age will vastly improve your
health and quality of life. The research is clear: few choices improve life
and life expectancy more than exercise. So do it, and you’ll feel terrific.
Don’t even consider it a choice!
Finally …
Remember that journal I asked you to keep at the start of this book? Well,
take it out now and do some self-reflection. Note how far you’ve come. But

look ahead, too. You have a lot of life yet to live. What do you want it to
look like? How would you describe the life of your dreams?
Answer these questions with no limitations, as if you are guaranteed of
not failing, but of having everything you want. Really allow yourself to
express your desires, aspirations, and what you want to truly do with the
rest of your life.
Your goals might be about fixing broken relationships … or making a
difference in the world … or even more specific, like staying healthy and
whole so you can enjoy your grandchildren someday (that’s one of mine).
It’s this kind of honesty and clarity that inspires us as to what’s important
on the journey ahead, and it helps us live with the hope that something
wonderful is about to happen each and every day.
You’re stepping into the most fulfilling season of your life. Enjoy it!
