---

## Proven Methodologies

### IIFYM / Flexible Dieting

**What it is:** "If It Fits Your Macros" - achieving daily macronutrient targets regardless of food choices.

**Evidence base:**
- First popularized by fitness coach Anthony Collova
- IIFYM.com calculator refined by Dr. Layne Norton (PhD Nutritional Sciences) and Dr. Joe Klemczewski (PhD)
- Over 10 million calculations used to refine algorithms
- Current recommendations based on December 2025 review

**Key principles:**
- Focus on protein (1.6-2.2g/kg), carbs, and fat targets
- No "forbidden foods" - flexibility aids long-term adherence
- Calorie deficit recommendations: 15-20% for fat loss
- Calorie surplus recommendations: 5-10% for muscle gain

**Pros:**
- Flexible and sustainable with no forbidden foods
- Educational - users learn about food composition
- Customizable for fat loss, muscle gain, or maintenance
- Leads to longer-term results than rigid diets

**Cons:**
- Micronutrients often overlooked
- Constant tracking can lead to obsessive behavior
- 73% of college students with eating disorders report tracking apps contributed to their condition

---

### Meal Timing / Nutrient Timing

**What it is:** Strategically timing nutrient intake around exercise for optimal adaptation.

**ISSN Position Stand (2017) - Key findings:**
- Ingesting 20-40g protein (0.25-0.40g/kg) every 3-4 hours optimizes muscle protein synthesis
- Pre- and post-exercise meals should not be separated by more than 3-4 hours
- Casein protein (30-40g) before sleep can increase overnight MPS without affecting fat burning

**The "Anabolic Window" Myth:**
- Traditional view: 30-60 minute post-workout window for protein
- Current evidence: Window is much larger (3-4+ hours)
- Better conceptualized as a "garage door of opportunity" rather than a narrow window

**Practical takeaway:**
- Total daily protein intake matters more than precise timing
- For non-exercising scenarios, meal frequency has limited impact on body composition
- Meal frequency mainly affects appetite and satiety

---

### Carb Cycling

**What it is:** Alternating between high-carb and low-carb days based on training demands.

**Evidence status:** Limited direct research

**Key research findings:**
- 2024 study on cyclists: Both periodized carb (PCHO) and high-carb (HCHO) groups showed similar improvements in body composition and performance
- Originated in bodybuilding for pre-competition leaning out
- 2017 study: Competitors report carb refeeds aid training performance and mental recovery

**Practical applications:**
- High-carb days: Training days, especially high-intensity
- Low-carb days: Rest days or low-intensity days
- Provides psychological relief from constant restriction

**Verdict:** Some anecdotal and theoretical support, but direct research comparing carb cycling to other diets is limited. Generally safe for short-term use.

---

### Reverse Dieting

**What it is:** Gradually increasing calories after a diet to minimize weight regain and metabolic adaptation.

**Evidence status:** Limited but growing

**Key research (2025):**
- University of South Florida study assessed reverse dieting vs. other post-dieting protocols
- 2025 meta-analysis in *Nutrition Reviews*: Intermittent dieting with break periods showed significantly smaller RMR reduction vs. continuous restriction
- Suggests diet breaks may attenuate metabolic adaptation

**Expert consensus:**
- "It doesn't trick your metabolism or reset your metabolism; it's just a common approach to weight maintenance"
- May help avoid yo-yo dieting by preventing rapid calorie increases

**Verdict:** Sensible approach lacking robust evidence. The 2025 research on intermittent dieting with breaks is promising.

---

### Diet Breaks / Refeeds

**What it is:** Planned periods of higher calorie/carb intake during extended diets.

**Evidence (2025 meta-analysis):**
- RMR was significantly reduced following continuous restriction only
- Intermittent dieting showed smaller compensatory RMR reduction
- More significant benefit for individuals with overweight/obesity vs. resistance-trained individuals

**Practical recommendations:**
- Diet break: 1-2 weeks at maintenance calories
- Refeed: 1-2 days of higher carbs (typically at maintenance)
- Helps with psychological adherence and potential metabolic benefits

## Macro Calculation Standards

### TDEE Formulas

| Formula | Accuracy | Best For | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Mifflin-St Jeor** | Most accurate | General population | Predicts within 10% for most users |
| Harris-Benedict | Good | Historical use | Developed 1919, revised 1984 |
| Katch-McArdle | Best for lean | Athletes with known BF% | Accounts for lean mass |

**Mifflin-St Jeor equations:**
- Males: (10 × weight[kg]) + (6.25 × height[cm]) - (5 × age) + 5
- Females: (10 × weight[kg]) + (6.25 × height[cm]) - (5 × age) - 161

**Activity multipliers:**
| Activity Level | Multiplier |
|----------------|------------|
| Sedentary | 1.2 |
| Lightly active | 1.375 |
| Moderately active | 1.55 |
| Very active | 1.725 |
| Extra active | 1.9 |

**Limitations:**
- Less accurate for extreme body weights
- May be less accurate for older adults
- Ethnic minorities underrepresented in validation studies

### Protein Recommendations

| Goal | Protein (g/kg) | Protein (g/lb) | Source |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Bulking** | 1.6-2.2 | 0.7-1.0 | ISSN, Meta-analysis |
| **Cutting** | 1.8-2.7 | 0.8-1.2 | BarBend, Research |
| **Maintenance** | 1.6-2.0 | 0.7-0.9 | General consensus |
| **Older adults (65+)** | 1.2-2.0 | 0.5-0.9 | Age-related muscle loss |

**Key insights:**
- Cutting requires MORE protein (counterintuitive) to preserve muscle during deficit
- Protein distribution: 20-40g per meal across 4-5 meals optimizes MPS
- Higher protein increases satiety and thermic effect (TEF)

**Sources:** [BarBend Calculator](https://barbend.com/protein-intake-calculator/), [Jeff Nippard](https://jeffnippard.com/blogs/news/the-smartest-way-to-use-protein-to-build-muscle-science-explained), [Menno Henselmans](https://mennohenselmans.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/)

### Macro Ratios by Goal

| Goal | Protein | Carbs | Fat | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Cutting (standard)** | 40% | 30% | 30% | High protein preserves muscle |
| **Cutting (low-carb)** | 40% | 20% | 40% | For carb-sensitive individuals |
| **Bulking** | 25-30% | 45-55% | 20-25% | Carbs fuel training |
| **Maintenance** | 30% | 40% | 30% | Balanced approach |
| **Competition prep** | 35-40% | Variable | 15-20% | Progressive carb reduction |

**Body type considerations:**
- **Ectomorph:** 25% P / 55% C / 20% F (higher carb tolerance)
- **Mesomorph:** 30% P / 40% C / 30% F (moderate tolerance)
- **Endomorph:** 35% P / 25% C / 40% F (lower carb tolerance)

---

### Deficit/Surplus Recommendations

| Goal | Calorie Change | Weekly Rate | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Aggressive cut** | -500 to -750 | 0.5-0.75kg/week | Risk of muscle loss |
| **Moderate cut** | -300 to -500 | 0.25-0.5kg/week | Recommended |
| **Lean bulk** | +200 to +300 | 0.25kg/week | Minimizes fat gain |
| **Standard bulk** | +300 to +500 | 0.25-0.5kg/week | Faster but more fat |

**IIFYM recommendations:**
- Fat loss: 15-20% deficit
- Muscle gain: 5-10% surplus

## User Pain Points

### From App Store Reviews

| App | Common Complaint | Example |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| **MyFitnessPal** | Barcode scanner paywalled | "Their database is user-generated, and paying 20 bucks a month for a barcode scanner is outrageous" |
| **MyFitnessPal** | Confusing layout after updates | "took a nice compact format and turned it into a giant slow running mess" |
| **MyFitnessPal** | Bugs and syncing issues | "Foods logged recently mysteriously not showing up" |
| **Eat This Much** | Recipe quality varies | "Recipes completely gross... even with all the potential flavor from fats, the food is still absolutely disgusting" |
| **Eat This Much** | Budget estimates inaccurate | "Bills almost double what it was supposed to be" |
| **Mealime** | Too basic | "No inventory list, freezer management, or saved meal plans" |
| **Mealime** | Shopping list resets | "Entire shopping list gets reset if you make any adjustments after you build it" |
| **RP Diet App** | Too rigid | "You have to eat a specific amount at each meal instead of daily targets" |
| **RP Diet App** | App laggy | "Mechanics for basic edit and interaction functions are laggy and often don't work" |
| **PlateJoy** | Technical issues | "Some customers say the app is buggy" |
| **PlateJoy** | Unclear support | "Increasingly opaque since acquisition" |

### From Community Discussions

**Top 10 Pain Points (Ranked by frequency):**

1. **Paywall frustration** - Essential features behind expensive subscriptions (especially MFP barcode scanner)
2. **Meal variety** - "Get the same meal options all the time"
3. **Complex interfaces** - Time-consuming to navigate, not intuitive
4. **Recipe quality** - AI/generated recipes often unappetizing
5. **Inaccurate data** - Barcode scanner returns wrong nutritional info
6. **Customization limits** - Can't adjust serving sizes easily
7. **Sync failures** - Data loss between devices
8. **Grocery list issues** - Lists reset, overestimate quantities
9. **Rigidity** - Apps too prescriptive vs. flexible
10. **Psychological burden** - Tracking leads to guilt, obsession, quitting

**Key insight:** Users want simplicity and flexibility, not complexity. Quote: "People admitted they cheated to make themselves feel better, didn't log that pint of ice cream. This often led to even more guilt... people completely gave up on the app and healthy habits altogether."

### MyFitnessPal Barcode Scanner Controversy

**Timeline:**
- October 2022: MFP moved barcode scanner behind $19.99/month paywall
- Users who contributed to building the database felt betrayed
- Ongoing backlash through 2024

**User sentiment:**
- "As a Dyslexic person, this wasn't an 'ease of use' feature, this is an accessibility feature"
- "A sign of greed on the part of MFP corporate"
- Many migrated to Cronometer, LoseIt, MacroFactor, or Macros

**Opportunity:** Free or low-cost barcode scanning is now a competitive differentiator.

---

## Market Positioning Recommendation

### The Gap

**What's missing that GetFed could own:**

1. **Australia-first:** No major competitor has Australian food database + local recipes + Australian terminology
2. **Simplicity + Macros:** Eat This Much is closest but recipe quality suffers; RP/Carbon are too rigid
3. **AI quality:** AI meal plans exist but recipe quality is inconsistent
4. **Couples/household:** Most apps are single-user focused; household meal planning with different goals is undersolved
5. **Affordable premium:** Gap between free (limited) and $15-25/month

---

### Positioning Statement

**Option A - Australia Focus:**
> "GetFed is the first meal planning app built for Australians who lift. Australian ingredients, Australian portions, Australian pricing."

**Option B - Simplicity Focus:**
> "GetFed gives you macro-perfect meal plans without the complexity. Tell us your goals, and we'll handle the rest."

**Option C - Couples/Household Focus:**
> "GetFed is the first meal planning app designed for couples and households with different fitness goals. One plan, different macros."

**Recommendation:** Start with Australia + Simplicity (Options A+B combined), with Couples as a differentiating feature.

---

### Target User Persona

**Primary: "Gym-Going Greg"**
- Age: 25-40
- Gender: 60% male, 40% female
- Location: Australian metro areas
- Activity: Lifts 3-5x/week
- Goals: Cutting for summer OR lean bulking
- Pain: Knows macros matter but hates tracking every meal
- Tech: Uses phone for tracking, expects modern UX
- Budget: Currently paying for gym ($60/month), maybe protein (~$50/month)
- Willingness to pay: $5-15/month for app that saves meal planning time

**Secondary: "Meal Prep Melissa"**
- Age: 28-45
- Situation: Partner or family with different dietary needs
- Activity: Moderate exercise, focused on body composition
- Pain: Plans meals for household where people have different goals
- Need: One grocery list, different portions

---

### Key Differentiators

1. **Australian-first database** - Local ingredients, brands, terminology
2. **Household meal planning** - Different macros, same meals, one shopping list
3. **Quality AI recipes** - Test and curate, not just generate
4. **Simplicity** - Less tracking, more automation
5. **Fair pricing** - $8-12/month, not $20+
