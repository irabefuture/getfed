## Willingness to Pay Context

### Australian Reference Prices

| Category | Price Range (AUD) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Gym membership (avg)** | $62/month | Higher in CBD ($85-89) |
| **Budget gym (24/7)** | $10-20/week | Zap Fitness, Plus Fitness |
| **Premium gym** | $65/week (~$260/month) | Fitness First, Virgin Active |
| **Meal delivery (per meal)** | $9-15/meal | My Muscle Chef, YouFoodz |
| **Meal kits (per serve)** | $8-13/serve | HelloFresh, Marley Spoon |
| **Protein powder** | $40-80/month | Based on usage |

**Key insight:** Australians already spending $62/month on gym + potentially $100-400/month on meal delivery/kits. A $10-15/month app is negligible by comparison.

   - $8.33/month effective price

3. **Household tier:**
   - Unique differentiator

---

### A/B Test Plan

**Test 1: Pricing Points**
- A: $9.99/mo vs B: $12.99/mo vs C: $14.99/mo
- Measure: Conversion rate, revenue per user

**Test 2: Free Tier Generosity**
- A: 3 plans/month vs B: 1 plan/month vs C: Trial only
- Measure: Free → Pro conversion, engagement

**Test 3: Annual Discount**
- A: 36% discount vs B: 50% discount vs C: No discount
- Measure: Monthly vs annual split, LTV

**Test 4: Trial Length**
- A: 7-day trial vs B: 14-day trial
- Measure: Trial → Paid conversion

---

### Revenue Projections

**Assumptions:**
- Year 1: 1,000 free users, 10% convert to paid
- Year 2: 5,000 free users, 12% convert to paid
- Year 3: 15,000 free users, 15% convert to paid
- 60% annual / 40% monthly split
- 7% monthly churn

| Scenario | Year 1 Users | Paid Users | Monthly Revenue (AUD) | Annual Revenue (AUD) |
|----------|--------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Conservative** | 1,000 | 100 | $900 | $10,800 |
| **Moderate** | 5,000 | 600 | $5,400 | $64,800 |
| **Optimistic** | 15,000 | 2,250 | $20,250 | $243,000 |

**Blended ARPU estimate:** ~$9/month (mix of monthly and annual)

**Break-even analysis:**
- If CAC = $20, need 2.5 months to recover
- At 7% monthly churn, average customer lifespan = 14 months
- LTV = 14 × $9 = $126
- LTV/CAC = $126/$20 = 6.3:1 (healthy)

- Consider USD for international expansion
- Stripe handles currency conversion

### Payment Methods
- Apple Pay / Google Pay essential
